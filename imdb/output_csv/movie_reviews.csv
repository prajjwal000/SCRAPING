tt0068646,rw1183339,SJ_1,10,2005-09-30,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don&#39;t like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn&#39;t change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That&#39;s why it gets ten out of ten.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn&#39;t seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it&#39;s far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.<br/><br/>The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It&#39;s a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven&#39;t seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn&#39;t disappoint.",984,220
tt0068646,rw0123163,mm-39,10,2001-05-16,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.  It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.",702,324
tt0068646,rw1066533,BrandtSponseller,10,2005-04-24,"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving &quot;business&quot; guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie&#39;s (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.<br/><br/>The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the &quot;greatest films of all time&quot;. Even though I&#39;ve given it a 10, I wouldn&#39;t put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I&#39;ve given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it&#39;s only because it&#39;s so highly regarded--if you&#39;ve not experienced the film yet. I think it&#39;s a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.<br/><br/>Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you&#39;ve watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, &quot;Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?&quot; The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film&#39;s appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.<br/><br/>But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather&#39;s brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi&#39;s violence is effective, setting that knob to &quot;11&quot; doesn&#39;t make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.<br/><br/>To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of &quot;oscillating&quot; dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.<br/><br/>But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It&#39;s tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota&#39;s score.<br/><br/>Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis&#39; unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you&#39;re looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) &quot;zoom out&quot; from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it&#39;s a long monologue from a minor character).<br/><br/>Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn&#39;t believe it&#39;s something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.<br/><br/>If you haven&#39;t seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the &quot;greatest film of all time&quot; hype. That&#39;s only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you&#39;ll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood&#39;s more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it&#39;s as much a &quot;historical family saga&quot; as a crime or gangster film.",470,358
tt0068646,rw0123518,ks4,9,2002-12-25,"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..<br/><br/>With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..<br/><br/>Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn&#39;t take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.<br/><br/>This is definetely a &quot;must see&quot; masterpiece.",551,229
tt0068646,rw3038370,CalRhys,,2014-06-20,"&#39;The Godfather&#39; is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed &#39;The Godfather&#39; I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let&#39;s start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, &#39;I believe in America&#39;, it&#39;s crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film&#39;s &quot;threshold&quot;. This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a feared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a respected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970&#39;s film industry (including a certain horse&#39;s head), &#39;The Godfather&#39; epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleone&#39;s are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood&#39;s greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made.",692,73
tt0068646,rw0123344,Neve_Fan,9,1998-08-11,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn&#39;t have a single flaw.  Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life.  There&#39;s scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don&#39;t forget them.   Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime.  Its really a movie about family.  The dialogue is just unbelievable.  I&#39;ve seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I&#39;m still amazed at how perfect it is.  The music, the acting, everything.  People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there&#39;s no way  that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather.  The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie.   Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I&#39;m crazy.",454,290
tt0068646,rw1496808,mattrochman,10,2006-10-14,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn&#39;t like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando&#39;s ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.<br/><br/>To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.<br/><br/>Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don&#39;s children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they&#39;re put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.<br/><br/>2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character&#39;s character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).<br/><br/>3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn&#39;t to make films as short as possible.<br/><br/>All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn&#39;t mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.<br/><br/>I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.",511,155
tt0068646,rw0123460,jojofla,1,2002-08-05,"I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as &quot;The Greatest Movie of All Time&quot;.  I&#39;ve seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind.  And I&#39;m not a teenager raised on MTV; I&#39;m in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I&#39;ve seen as many classics (American &amp; foreign) that I can get my hands on.  But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin&#39; in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time.<br/><br/> Singin&#39; in the Rain, at least, I get (it&#39;s just my intense dislike for Donald O&#39;Connor that makes me dislike this film).  But The Godfather?   It&#39;s just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence.  Give me a break.  The fact that this movie is so &quot;beloved&quot; has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers.",202,462
tt0068646,rw0123309,b-a-h TNT-6,10,2002-03-05,"The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for &quot;gangster movies&quot;, but its influence goes well beyond that.<br/><br/>The Godfather&#39;s influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every &quot;organized crime film&quot; nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public&#39;s imagination.<br/><br/>But to say that The Godfather is simply &quot;influential&quot; is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as &quot;a movie about gangsters&quot;. The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.<br/><br/>As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors&#39; performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.<br/><br/>The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone&#39;s daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don&#39;s power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.<br/><br/>However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone&#39;s ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.<br/><br/>To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito&#39;s younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his &quot;innocence&quot; and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.<br/><br/>I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.<br/><br/>There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra&#39;s real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won&#39;t go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.<br/><br/>The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.<br/><br/>The Godfather certainly doesn&#39;t need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.",533,112

tt0068646,rw0123298,MovieAlien,1,2002-02-16,"I finally got a chance to see this movie. I tried to watch it with an open mind, without letting the hype dilute an even slight bit of impartiality - and I just can&#39;t say it&#39;s a very good movie. Perchance if soap opera was its own category, this may stand true to its title as &quot;#1&quot; on the IMDb.<br/><br/>   It perplexes me how people can call this landmark moviemaking when they probably have not seen works from other directors - Kurosawa, Truffaut, Lang... - all of whom had a much better eye than Coppolla. Most of these greats are now forgotten, with the exceptions of occasional screenings at film schools where one discovers that the Contemporary filmmaking style overseas  (1950s and 1960s)  was duplicated by American directors in the 1970s. <br/><br/> So what was wrong with this movie? Nonexistent or loose plot: No suspense, climax, excitement, or outcome. I thought the acting/characters were forgettable. Any other actor could have pulled off what Brando did and the fact they went through all that trouble to make him 10 or 20 year older just proves they shot for name recognition. <br/><br/> There were only a few things that I remember in this 3 hours of triviality: the &quot;offer you can&#39;t refuse&quot; line, Don Vito collapsing in a garden while a child obliviously plays, Caan&#39;s Santino character getting holed up, and bullets consistently going into foreheads. Maybe the artful yet repellent depiction of gratuitous violence is what made this such a masterpiece. But style without substance does not a good movie make.<br/><br/> For those who say &quot;oh, you just didn&#39;t get it, see it again&quot;, please get your mind out of the gutter - stop basing your opinions on what you&#39;re conditioned to like. <br/><br/>The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes, big time. End of review.",164,379
tt0068646,rw0123507,sddavis63,6,2002-11-25,"First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.<br/><br/>I thought &quot;The Godfather&quot; was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn&#39;t call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve finally seen it, but nothing more.<br/><br/>The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone&#39;s daughter&#39;s wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone&#39;s &quot;business&quot; never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn&#39;t actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn&#39;t think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone&#39;s son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family &quot;business&quot; to the eventual &quot;Don.&quot;<br/><br/>It&#39;s not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I&#39;ve seen better.<br/><br/>6/10",284,247

tt0068646,rw4756923,andrewburgereviews,10,2019-04-01,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;. I should probably go to bed. It&#39;s late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.<br/><br/>This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it&#39;s so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.<br/><br/>But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it&#39;s not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter&#39;s wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.<br/><br/>The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone&#39;s youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister&#39;s wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.<br/><br/>Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.<br/><br/>This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.<br/><br/>Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; or &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.",440,51
tt0068646,rw0123275,setanta-,1,2002-01-18,"I remember distinctly the first time I saw &quot;The Godfather&quot;. I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television.  Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film.  I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it.<br/><br/>The second time I saw the film was in college.  My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted &quot;The Godfather&quot; as the finest film.  One evening my friend and I watched the film.  The viewing once again left me unimpressed.  I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation.  Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a &quot;good movie&quot; when I saw one.<br/><br/>Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare.  I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed &quot;The Godfather&quot; again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants.  Well, I think you know the outcome.  As they say in baseball, three strikes and you&#39;re out.<br/><br/>I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way.  I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow.  There is no moral center.<br/><br/>I do not demand that a movie have morality.  I do not demand that a film even have a point.  I can take a film at its face value for what it is.  A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire.  The problem is that &quot;The Godfather&quot; aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations.<br/><br/>Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film&#39;s philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza.  However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst.  We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man&#39;s foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it.  Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself.<br/><br/>Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather&#39; as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men.  But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous.  To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider.<br/><br/>I find it interesting that many of those who claim &quot;The Godfather&quot; as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the &quot;fans&quot; I know.  A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD &quot;Godfather&quot; collection that he received for Christmas.  As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it?  That is faint praise indeed for the &quot;greatest film of all time&quot;.<br/><br/>I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie.  I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a paper tiger.",152,339
tt0068646,rw1118627,vjeet_a,10,2005-07-04,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, &quot;Oh that was 10 out of 10.&quot; If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there.

Might be worth watching once just to say you have, but you&#39;ll probably never watch it again. Definitely not &quot;best movie ever material.&quot;",137,309
tt0068646,rw1292892,mbuchwal,1,2006-02-15,"Does &quot;Godfather&quot; romanticize crime and criminals? Yes, it does. Take, for instance, the Godfather&#39;s name &quot;Corleone&quot; which translates as &quot;Lionhearted,&quot; suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to Richard the Lionhearted, legendary chivalrous hero of the Crusades and friend to Robin Hood. There can be no doubt that author Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola have made romantic idols of the Corleones, as the film gilds them with mystery, honor and gallantry. But of what Holy Crusade are the Corleones the leaders? Seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang. But why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals? <br/><br/>&quot;Godfather&quot; is just as much interesting for what it fails to show the audience as what it does show. The film makers wrongly assume that the audience is sophisticated enough to infer the kind of lurid but educational scene that made such a great success of earlier gangster films, nitty gritty illustrations of the inside workings of organized crime: loan sharking, extortion and vice. &quot;Godfather&quot; for the most part ignores this subject matter, the everyday business of crime, in favor of what should be only the end part of its story: a war between gangs over control of the rackets. The drama is essentially without motivation. The movie is simply not interested in showing us much of the dirty business that is the reason for the war. That is because the heroes would seem much less chivalrous if their criminal enterprises were shown in any depth or with any real understanding. For most of its length, the movie plays as a revenge tragedy in which the gallant protagonists could be members of any great family (whether criminal or not) protecting their cherished honor.<br/><br/>Why did the film makers deliberately sanitize the criminal aspect of the Corleone family? Are they apologists for crime? I think they are. One confidence game employed by the film makers, which is also familiar among the annals of organized crime leaders, is a variation on the trick called &quot;bait and switch.&quot; We expect a portrait of a ruthless and immoral criminal, instead we are made to believe in the essential moral rightness of Don Corleone when he condemns as a contemptible enemy the kind of criminal who trades in narcotics. In other words, we are lured into the theater with the promise of a true to life depiction of the actions of a bad guy, and then the film makers slyly pull a fast one and show us a good guy instead! (We are persuaded to ignore the fact that the Godfather is an extortionist and pimp  even worse we are asked to believe that extortion and pimping are not so bad, especially if practiced by an honorable guy like Don Corleone, who, whatever his failings, is much too decent to trade in narcotics.) <br/><br/>This jiggery pokery was so effective that around the time the movie and its sequel came out an ivy league educated friend of mine on his way to a brilliant career on Wall Street bitterly denounced a critic of &quot;Godfather&quot; for making the claim that Don Corleone was not entitled to be regarded as a great hero like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Douglas MacArthur or Doctor Albert Schweitzer, who had received similarly adulatory treatment in film. My friend, having seen both Godfathers, was convinced that a Mafia leader might be just as honorable as the heroic portrait the movies presented.<br/><br/>So, I feel some need on this occasion to remind the public of what the Mafia does, even when they allegedly refuse to get involved in narcotics sales. The Mafia is mainly in the business of Vice. It feeds off the weaknesses of a mass of little people who are corruptible, who are vulnerable to the appeal of easy sex, cheap thrills, quick money and quick fixes of their problems. These little people pay for their vices all their lives, much more than they can afford to pay, and end up ruined for the greater glory of the Mafia. Most racket crime is not glorious; it is petty and mean and easily committed by anyone who has less courage or daring than the average person. But it&#39;s easy to understand why the film makers left this out of the movie. It would be kind of absurd to call a scuzzy dirtbag by the name &quot;Lionheart.&quot;",123,273
tt0068646,rw1456986,maliceinwonderland88,1,2006-08-24,"This movie is ridiculously overrated. It is merely a overly dramatized celluloid interpretation of life involved with the Italian Mafia. Yes, organized crime is a problem, but this movie is NOT all that amazing. There are entirely too many references to it in other movies, too many spoofs and too many quotes. It&#39;s a bad movie. Let it go. There is no real plot line and the bad accents were enough to give me a headache. This movie is mind numbingly boring. It feels as though I lose brain cells every time I am forced to watch this painfully shallow film. Most films following along a similar premise are horribly dull. Why does everyone rave about movies like this and Scarface? They are awful, overly exaggerated and generally badly constructed cinematic failures. A decent script and plot line were substituted for gratuitous blood, gore and explosions. A good movie starts with a good story and a good script, this lacks both. Every aspect of this movie was horribly boring. It does NOT deserve to be named &quot;The Best Movie of All Time.&quot;",118,257
tt0068646,rw1897116,alexkolokotronis,10,2008-06-21,"Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can&#39;t. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.<br/><br/>The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.<br/><br/>The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.<br/><br/>The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.<br/><br/>The horse&#39;s head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, &quot;I&#39;ll give him an offer he can&#39;t refuse&quot; and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don&#39;t know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made.",276,58
tt0068646,rw0123321,ericjg623,8,2002-04-04,"One thing that&#39;s a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather&#39; is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.<br/><br/>
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there&#39;s really nothing in this movie that you couldn&#39;t get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.<br/><br/>What&#39;s best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.<br/><br/>
What&#39;s not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn&#39;t really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.<br/><br/>And that, at heart, is my problem. I&#39;ve seen the movie and I&#39;ve read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike&#39;s hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).<br/><br/>So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn&#39;t very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. The acting wasn&#39;t as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather&#39; is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.<br/><br/>8/10",184,145

tt8080122,rw6850951,skepticskeptical,6,2021-04-26,"I was intrigued by the first couple of episodes of Godfather of Harlem, but eventually I realized that the entire show is a pastiche of previous masterpieces in a bizarre alternate history production which is likely to mislead anyone who does not read books. Nearly every major character appears to have closely studied and emulated his/her analogue in either The Sopranos, The Wire, American Gangster or some related previous production. (Adam Clayton Powell is very similar to Clay Davis, to offer only one of many examples.) If this were a stand-alone, premiere series of black organized crime, then I would give it a higher rating. But it just seems like a multi-dimensional copycat collage of classic films and series about organized crime, most of the interest of which derives from the completely false narratives holding the production together.<br/><br/>Update: Now that I have watched all of season 1, I will say that the uniqueness in Godfather of Harlem inheres entirely in the alternate-reality history portrayed. Bumpy is best buddies with Malcolm X and also friends with Cassius Clay, both devout Muslims. In fact, fully half of the series focuses on Malcolm X, which strikes me as somewhat odd, especially if the relationship depicted is completely fictional. It seems implausible that religious persons would not shun Bumpy for his insistence on holding on to his Harlem heroin business, even though his very own daughter was an addict for more than twelve years. How could this be true? I presume that it is not. Another wild implausibility is that mafia boss Chin&#39;s daughter fell in love with Teddy despite being raised in a manifestly racist family. I mean it is possible, but very, very unlikely.<br/><br/>As usual, some of the gangsters are glamorized--in this case it&#39;s the black ones. The Italians are depicted as morally inferior, but let&#39;s be honest: they are all a bunch of murderers. Bumpy is made to seem a likable family man, but, again, it requires a serious degree of cluelessness to not recognize that all of his wealth derives not from uplifting the poor people in Harlem by in turning them into addicts. Heroin is very, very addictive and by providing the white powder to his neighbors, Bumpy is destroying many of their lives.<br/><br/>Unlike many other reviewers, I am not troubled by the use of modern rap music as the score. But the writing is in places very amateur, with characters saying things for the sole purpose of info dumping on the viewers. Accomplished screenwriters avoid dialogue that does not advance the story and never put ridiculous words such as &quot;So sorry!&quot; in the mouths of people who would never say them.",32,15

Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert  DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .<br/><br/>Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .<br/><br/>Watch this movie and learn why it is the greatest gangster film of all time.",582,129
tt0071562,rw0135526,DanB-4,10,1999-05-07,"The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world&#39;s view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.<br/><br/>As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.<br/><br/>The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world&#39;s most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.<br/><br/>
Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael&#39;s father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.<br/><br/>The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (&quot;Keep your friends close .....&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t want to kill everyone, just my enemies&quot;), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.<br/><br/>All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it&#39;s what&#39;s deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man&#39;s life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.<br/><br/>The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father&#39;s empire was built on love and respect, Michael&#39;s empire is built on fear and violent treachery.<br/><br/>See this movie. It&#39;s three-and-a-half hours very well spent.",581,117
tt0071562,rw0135607,Nazi_Fighter_David,10,2001-03-10,"Coppola&#39;s masterpiece is rivaled only by &quot;The Godfather, Part II&quot; in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...The film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young Vito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian ghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son, Michael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...<br/><br/>Al Pacino&#39;s performance is quiet and solemn... He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... Here he&#39;s a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies...<br/><br/>The film&#39;s haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...<br/><br/>De Niro&#39;s rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacino&#39;s relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...<br/><br/>The entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: Lee Strasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; G. D. Spradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt Nevada Senator; Michael V. Gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; Gastone Moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; John Cazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant Fredo; Diane Keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife Kay; Talia Shire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; Troy Donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and Robert Duvall excels as the confidant, and retainer to the all-powerful Corleone family...<br/><br/>Coppola&#39;s motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it&#39;s a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor...

tt0071562,rw0135563,ballen8,10,2000-02-01,"The Godfather Part 2 is the finest sequel ever made and is arguably a finer film than the original Godfather. The film is divided into two main parts - the story of a young Vito Corleone (flawlessly acted by Robert De Niro and a worthy Oscar winner) and the rise to power of Michael as the head of the family. Francis Coppola recollaborated with many of the crew members of the first film and again achieves a quite superb period piece thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and set design of Dean Tavoularis. The acting performances are outstanding, hence three supporting oscar nominations for acting guru Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth), Michael Gazzo (Frank Pentangeli) and Robert De Niro (young Vito Corleone). Duvall, Keaton, Cazale and Shire all provided first rate performances but it is the performance of Al Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool, calculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the original movie and brings us into the family&#39;s activities in Nevada, Florida and Havana. Arguably the finest movie of the 70s, a cinematic masterpiece with the greatest ensemble acting you will probably see.",261,73
tt0071562,rw1077513,BrandtSponseller,9,2005-05-10,"Series note: It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen The Godfather (1972) first. This is a direct continuation of that story.<br/><br/>The good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can&#39;t possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what&#39;s basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.<br/><br/>Director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) &quot;in the role&quot; of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn&#39;t so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.<br/><br/>After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone&#39;s mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the &quot;inside&quot; was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn&#39;t convey Michael&#39;s underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.<br/><br/>During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren&#39;t well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.<br/><br/>Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended &quot;flashback&quot; segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that&#39;s a bit of my bias creeping in, as I&#39;m a huge De Niro fan.<br/><br/>But let&#39;s talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we&#39;re toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.<br/><br/>There&#39;s also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I&#39;d now call &quot;J.K. Rowling Syndrome&quot;. That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.<br/><br/>The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the dénouement, which seems to just end.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn&#39;t a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.<br/><br/>The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can&#39;t remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.<br/><br/>Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film&#39;s importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see.",207,111

tt0071562,rw1765280,RichardKleiner,7,2007-11-17,"OK. Let&#39;s get real. The Godfather is beyond excellent in every single way. I&#39;m not giving comments on The Godfather, because it would be almost blasphemy. Nevertheless, I expected much more on part II. Personally, I didn&#39;t like it. Here&#39;s the deal: the story was way too slow paced. Nothing really happened. Only the hit on Michael&#39;s house, and the build up for young Vito&#39;s story was what makes you interested. The rest is just anti-climatic and dull. The dialogs weren&#39;t as quotable or stand alone as in the first. I thought as a sad imitation of the real thing.<br/><br/>Al Pacino&#39;s performance was absolutely superb. The problem wasn&#39;t that. The whole character was what failed. In the first, we get the glimpse of a warm man, but gets cold when is needed. A man who thinks before he talks. In this one, we see a man who is cold and heartless every single time you see him. He no longer has the eminence that Vito Corleone once had. The previous Don was eminent and even though he could scare the hell out of you with his stare, you respected and looked up to him. Now, his son is just pure evil. And that doesn&#39;t make sense. In the book, it&#39;s clear that Michael is the living image of his father. So, what happened? Him killing Fredo was completely useless. Even if he did betray him, there was no need to have him whacked. A Don just doesn&#39;t kill anyone from his own family (not &quot;the Family&quot;, the real one). I know, Michael did kill Carlo, but let&#39;s remember he was not really family, just an in-law, and he did deserve what was coming. Another thing I personally hated was what happened to Connie. As you will see in the third, she radically changes from the naive Don&#39;s daughter to... Sorry, wrong movie. Anyway, all the other aspects, (filmmaking, score, performances, photography)were indeed flawless. <br/><br/>It&#39;s interesting. You can perfectly notice Coppola&#39;s anatomy for each &quot;Godfather&quot;. You start with a prologue, then a religious ceremony and/or a party afterward, the plot then starts and a pivotal point is a hit on the Don. The rest is a slow, yet properly thought vengeance that ends with a gigantic and operatic blood bath. However, for part II, it wasn&#39;t&#39;s that operatic or with the same effect than part I. It was anti-climatic, and pretty disappointing.<br/><br/>Another flaw I found was that the story doesn&#39;t really stick to the book. One key aspect in the film didn&#39;t even appear in Mario Puzo&#39;s novel: Vito Corleone never returned to Sicily. The name of the Don who had his family killed doesn&#39;t even matter. Still, the scene prominently explains Don Tomassino&#39;s condition from the first.<br/><br/>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;m a die hard fan of &quot;The Godfather&quot;. I consider it to be the best movie ever (and the best novel ever, too). But part II just doesn&#39;t do it for me.",110,77

Sure you can give it credit for getting the historic periods accurate but do set design, costumes and props make a great movie? I think not.<br/><br/>This actually could have easily been two movies and made each more bearable to watch though not anymore exciting.<br/><br/>The public&#39;s fascination with organized crime is very disturbing. These are hollow, morally void movies. So what the godfather was a &quot;family man&quot; that justifies his brutality? Just like people&#39;s attachment to the Godfather in the first movie because he didn&#39;t want to get into drugs and showed &quot;loyalty&quot; to his family (so long as he was king). You cannot sugar coat depravity and thuggery. They are what they are, pathetic and empty excuses for criminal behavior. Maybe people&#39;s lives are so boring they become mentally disturbed? I don&#39;t know, I am simply trying to rationalize this behavior. Idolizing criminals who get weak-minded people to fear them and then pretend themselves to be &quot;emperors&quot; among their &quot;subjects&quot; is downright pathetic. I suspect people pretend in their own minds to have this control over others, this fake respect and false sense of self-worth.<br/><br/>This is how I imagine they envision it,<br/><br/>&quot;Hey look I&#39;m a dumb Sicilian who says stupid phrases with double meanings and then brutally murders others.

Don&#39;t answer that (we know it is).<br/><br/>All I wanted to see was Michael Corleone die and he never died. He just kept brooding on and on and on for 3 hours! For some reason Michael can just kill everyone he wants in the last five minutes of every movie yet no one can kill him? Apparently he always wears full body armor and drives around only in a tank? Yet in the movie he frequently goes all over the place in just a regular suit and car. How is this so? Maybe his magic fear aura just repels anyone who would ever think of killing him!<br/><br/>The fans of these movies miss the obvious because they are so into Al Pacino brooding around posing for the camera and fantasizing of being the Godfather.<br/><br/>What a waste of time.",56,113
tt0071562,rw1901866,alexkolokotronis,10,2008-06-30,"To me and probably to many other people The Godfather Part II is more of a continuation than sequel to The Godfather. Just look at the IMDb rating and you&#39;ll see I&#39;m not the only one who feels this way. To me it as good as the first.<br/><br/>The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.<br/><br/>The directing once again is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola know or at least knew how to make a movie. The first to Godfather movie are done so precisely and perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they are so perfect throughout. Coppola just lets his actors play everything out as he should with type of cast he has here. Not to many movies can maintain such a consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even an hour and 45 minutes.<br/><br/>The writing may not have been quite as good as the first in terms of quoting but the storyline was perfect. Seeing the decisions made by new mob boss Michael Corleone was common sense but flashing back on Vito Corleone&#39;s life was genius. The storyline to me could not have been better and Coppola and Puzo do a great job with it all the way.<br/><br/>Like the first the cinematography was amazing but it had a slightly different tone to it. The first had more of a majestic, mythical look to it. In Part II you feel the modern times creeping in and the Corleones having to adjust to it. Part II has more of a corrupt and evil twist to it but I guess the end signifies that. The music obviously the same as the first was perfect and just fit so greatly with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The first to movies of The Godfather series are really like the same movie. They are not the same though, they are actually very different but the greatness of them both and the continuation of the storyline from the first to the second really create a strong band between each other. To me it is only a sequel in that it was the second movie of a great series. No let downs, no disappointments just a continuation of of the greatness from the first one.",124,43
tt0071562,rw0135487,tfrizzell,,2001-10-13,"&quot;The Godfather, Part II&quot; is excellent just like its predecessor. While the first is arguably the greatest film ever made, the second installment is easily the best sequel produced hands down. The film is split between the stories of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, Oscar-nominated) and a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in his star-making, first Oscar-winning performance). In the 1950s, Michael is trying to expand his crime empire to locales such as Las Vegas, Hollywood, and even turbulent Cuba. However, there are numerous problems as older brother Fredo (John Cazale) may have double-crossed the family. Also two prominent crime bosses pose a considerable threat as well (Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo, both Oscar-nominated). Younger sister Connie (Oscar nominee Talia Shire) is still reeling from her husband&#39;s murder and her father&#39;s death at the conclusion of the original film. Michael is also distancing himself from his wife (Diane Keaton) and some of his most trusted friends (Robert Duvall). While all this is occurring we get glimpses into the early life of Michael&#39;s father (De Niro). We learn that his parents and older brother have been killed in early-1900s Sicily and that he has immigrated to New York. Vito pays his dues and learns the tricks of the trade, buying his time, before deciding to create his own small empire which would of course grow and become what we saw in the original. It would seem that the film would be confusing by jumping back and forth between Michael and his father, but that is not so. Coppola gives you just enough information to keep the audience intrigued through each segment. The film is very well-made and runs very smoothly even though it lasts over 200 minutes. Many think that this installment is the best of the series. Even though I still think that the original is the best, I cannot totally disagree with this assertion as this is the definitive sequel. 5 stars out of 5.",130,33
tt0071562,rw0135692,MovieAddict2016,10,2003-08-23,"This sequel is just as terrific as the first film, if not more so. I hesitate to call it a sequel, as &quot;sequel&quot; is quite simply the wrong word I am looking for. A film like &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; is a sequel - &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; is something more. It&#39;s just too good to be called a sequel.<br/><br/>The film won six Oscars in 1974, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro). It deserved every one. It involves the viewer from the start and never lets up. Particular aspects I enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child immigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland, Sicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito (Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms with his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life. <br/><br/>Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions).<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito Corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon Brando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. Indeed, he did.<br/><br/>Coppola&#39;s magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the script by Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The original was a wonderful film, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of other films are awkward times, but in &quot;The Godfather Part II,&quot; Coppola uses them at precisely the right moments, managing to careen in and out of scenes and time periods with free abandon.<br/><br/>It takes a great kind of skill to master something like this, much less a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. &quot;The Godfather&quot; was an instant classic upon its release in 1972. Coppola had two years to plan for his continuation of the film. People told him it wouldn&#39;t work, he would never beat the original, and he would never pull it off. But he showed them all. &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; may well be the best sequel I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. I wish they were all this good. To call it a &quot;sequel&quot; almost seems insulting.",124,33

This is the only film that delivers both. I loved the first Godfather film, for it&#39;s acting talent, for it&#39;s cinematography, and for it&#39;s fantastic story. The acting is every bit as great, and the cinematography is about as good, but the story wasn&#39;t exactly as good as the first; had it not been for the flashbacks that showed Vito as young(beautifully portrayed by De Niro), it wouldn&#39;t have gotten a perfect rating from me. He saved the film, that was otherwise slow and a little bland, due to the story not being as great as the first. The first showed us a mafia war; this just shows the aftermath, and Michael Corleone&#39;s further rise to power, after the fall of Vito in the first. However, the film has a number of flashbacks, that show us Vito as young, and here De Niro perfectly shows us the entire range of his talents, by mimicking Brando&#39;s performance to perfection. The plot is good, but not as good as the first; it&#39;s saved by the flashback sequences that show us how and why Vito Corleone came to power. The acting is every bit as great as the first. Al Pacino still gives a great performance, like he did in the first, and the other cast members who came back from the first, including Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, also give as great performances as they did in the first. The new actors also give great performances, though the following stand out as the best; Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo. The characters are as well-written as they were in the first. The mafia is portrayed as menacingly in this as it was in the first. The film, like the first, has it&#39;s share of memorable quotes, but not really any scenes that were memorable, like the first one had. All in all, a great film, but mainly because of De Niro and Pacino. De Niro fills Brando&#39;s part fairly well, but overall, the film isn&#39;t as entertaining and exciting as the first, though it does reach about the same quality overall. I recommend it to fans of the various actors involved, and of course anyone who enjoyed the first, as they should enjoy this one too, but possibly to a lesser extent. 10/10",74,61

tt0071562,rw3427562,BA_Harrison,6,2016-03-07,"The Godfather Part II is one of those rare sequels that is regarded by many to be as good as, if not better than, the original. I&#39;m guessing that much of its popularity lies in the fact that it is not just a sequel, following Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as he continues to expand his family&#39;s &#39;business&#39;, but also a prequel, charting Vito Corleone&#39;s life from a child in Sicily at the turn of the 20th century to powerful New York mafia don. Two films for the price of one!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as far as I&#39;m concerned, only half of this &#39;double-bill&#39; is really worth the time and effort. The flashbacks are great, with Robert De Niro superb as the young adult Vito, rising from shop assistant to mob boss; these parts reminded me of the excellent Once Upon A Time In America, which also charted the early lives of young gangsters (and which also starred De Niro). In contrast, the scenes featuring Michael&#39;s continuing underworld activities in the &#39;50s are far too convoluted and slow for their own good, making keeping up with the Corleones more of a chore than a pleasure.<br/><br/>8/10 for the flashbacks; 4/10 for the rest.

tt0071562,rw1511920,Soysoy,5,2006-11-02,"So this is something that ranks as #2 on IMDb... this time I think I have to face the fact that I&#39;m totally disconnected from the vast majority of movie addicts. So take this review with a grain of salt: I&#39;m an outsider, definitely.<br/><br/>I kinda liked the first Godfather, while not considering it as great cinema I found it engaging, well put together, with strong moments, all in all a good movie. Not so here. To me this was excruciatingly boring.<br/><br/>I actually liked the overture scenes very much. Then we leave Italy for the USA, and after 40 minutes I was still waiting for something to vaguely interest me. These endless contrived stories about the Italian Mafia (mob) have become such a cliché in movies that it&#39;s impossible for me to attend all this convoluted, ultra-codified stuff without getting successively amused, then annoyed, then plain bored. So when the cinematic and staging aspects are great, like in SCARFACE or ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, I just take that stuff for what it is, a genre film bound by rules, and enjoy it from the great acting, direction and purely cinematic elements (in De Palma&#39;s case -Scarface- the fabulous camera eye, in Leone&#39;s case -Once upon a time- the mindblowing psychological staging and the terrific cinematography).<br/><br/>Here the staging is mostly sloppy, long parts of the movie feels like it&#39;s been produced too fast, with poor cinematography and loose acting, some others are just as good as in the first movie but they&#39;re too scarce.<br/><br/>Pretty average, exploitative, complacent stuff for me. Sorry, I&#39;ve seen so many movies that I need much more than that to be impressed.

tt0099674,rw0281994,tfrizzell,,2001-10-13,"Many believed that the series was complete in 1974. Even Francis Ford Coppola thought that another installment was unlikely. However in 1990, some 16 years later, &quot;The Godfather, Part III&quot; was released with results that few could have perceived. The film was not very successful at the box office and many who did see the movie said &quot;ho-hum&quot;. The critics were also indifferent to an extent. A Christmas release would create enough steam for the film to achieve a best picture nomination and seven nominations in all from the Academy (it failed to win any though). Of course &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; dominated the night and that film along with &quot;GoodFellas&quot; are considered the class acts of that year. Why has &quot;The Godfather, Part III&quot; failed to achieve a following like its two predecessors (parts I &amp; II)? I am not sure I can answer that question. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is becoming an old man and his health is slowly worsening. He wants the family to become 100% legitimate and even makes a deal to link his finances to the Vatican. However Michael has become a bit naive and everyone double-crosses him. Now it appears that the only answer is to get back to the old ways. Younger sister Connie (Talia Shire) believes that Michael has grown soft and that Santino&#39;s (James Caan from the first film) illegitimate son should take control (Andy Garcia, in his Oscar-nominated performanece). He is ambitious and has the short fuse that his late father had and this is going to lead to fireworks for the family. He also starts seeing Michael&#39;s teenaged daughter (Sofia Coppola, Francis Ford&#39;s real-life daughter) and a romance blossoms. Meanwhile crime bosses Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna pose threats to the Corleones. Kaye (Diane Keaton) has divorced herself from Michael and their son (Franc D&#39;Ambrosio) has somewhat sided with her. Michael&#39;s health takes a turn for the worse as he actually goes into a diabetic coma for a time during the film and when he does recover (not completely though) he starts to reflect on a life of loss. The ordering of Fredo&#39;s death (John Cazale) in the second installment and his Sicilian wife&#39;s murder in the original haunt Michael and he tries to come to terms with his life, but learns from a Catholic cardinal while in Sicily that he deserves all the suffering he experiences and realizes that his suffering will be even greater in the future. In fact there will be a finale that will be the &quot;fatal nail in the coffin&quot; for Michael. &quot;The Godfather, Part III&quot; is focused on Michael and that is why it is unique to the series. The first two sported so many rich characters that it was impossible to focus on just one. This film could be best described as &quot;Reflections of a Life of Loss&quot;. The film is excellent and even though it is likely the weakest of the three when you compare them, it is somewhat unfair to put the three &quot;Godfather&quot; movies together because they can all stand on their own. Great movies stand on their own and &quot;The Godfather, Part III&quot; does just that. 5 stars out of 5.",593,142
tt0099674,rw0976227,tazamaster,10,2004-12-11,"Having heard the endless amount of critique and insults that the last part of the Godfather saga carries.. I have to disagree. Although people seem to love to hate Sophie Coppola and say she ruined the film, I think her part alone wasn&#39;t that frail it&#39;d ruin the entire cinematic experience. Saying that is just humorous. Also, the absence of Tom Hagen played by Robert Duvall is really a loss and even I think this film would&#39;ve been a lot better if there was him in it.. but he got too greedy and couldn&#39;t make it into the movie, and that&#39;s that. I&#39;m not going to judge a movie by what it could have been, but what it is and how good it ends up being.<br/><br/>Despite some shortcomings, Godfather Part 3 is a decent ending to the trilogy. While it may have been an attempt to cash off the audience, they still have Coppola bring us his finest directing. I found Al Pacino&#39;s performance extremely satisfying and even terrifyingly so. He embodies the mistakes and losses of his life with excellent skill, showing us a don that has lost his health, the loved ones of his life and even the respect for himself. While I never found Diane Keaton&#39;s performances in the saga that good, she still fills the spot required, same goes for Talia Shire, whose role in the ending finale of the film really came as a surprise to me - which was a good thing. I didn&#39;t find her role in Part 2 too appealing but in this one she has more character, more importance. Sophie Coppola was OK, like I said a lot of people have complained about her acting skills and I gotta admit she was a little &quot;stiff&quot; or sorts in some scenes but it&#39;s not notable all the time and it didn&#39;t spoil any moods for me. Andy Carcia was just excellent, my favorite add to the saga cast, playing the son of his father with excellence.<br/><br/>So, umm.. this film is perfectly fine. The ending finale was tremendously well shot and very climatic, filled with a lot of excitement. I&#39;m telling you this movie is a great ending to the saga even because of that one particular scene so just go see it, despite what a lot of people have said about, badmouthing it for faulty reasons.. it brought a tear into my eye.

It was a good film. Not great, not intense as the first two Godfather flicks, but definitely a lot better than advertised.<br/><br/>Many people said this was filled with anti-Roman Catholic propaganda, but I didn&#39;t it find that way. Yes, the &quot;Vatican bank,&quot; whatever that is, was portrayed as not on the up-and-up, but it was a little confusing to follow, maybe too confusing to get offended! Actually, there were some positive things, religious-wise, with Al Pacino&#39;s character, who sought forgiveness for his past sins and made a few very profound statements such as, &quot;What good is confession if it isn&#39;t followed by repentance?&quot;<br/><br/>Anyway, Pacino&#39;s acting talents are the main attraction in the lower-key, more cerebral Godfather film. There isn&#39;t that much action but when it occurs, it&#39;s pretty violent. As with the other two films in the series, it&#39;s nicely photographed with a lot of nice brown tints.<br/><br/>Finally, director-writer Francis Ford Coppola took a lot of flak for putting his daughter in such an important role but I thought she (Sofia Coppola) was fine and - like this film - unfairly criticized.",409,124

When the Corleone family begin to deal with the Vatican and plan to buy out their share of an multinational corporation he finds that the Vatican is just as corrupt as his illegal operations were.  Despite his best efforts he finds himself sucked back into the world he has tried to leave behind.<br/><br/>Easily one of the most hated films ever made  or at least you&#39;d think it was by the critical mauling it got for a raft of reasons.  However watching it now it isn&#39;t that bad and really it only suffers from comparison with the two films before it.  But lets be fair, Coppola has made 3 or 4 of the best films ever made  did we really expect another one from him?<br/><br/>The film has a reasonable plot and brings the trilogy to a logical end.  The plot however does have it&#39;s weaknesses  for example it starts well with Michael&#39;s attempt to `get out&#39; being hampered by other families on their way up.  But when it starts to get involved with money laundering through the Vatican and the corruption therein, it starts to lose it&#39;s way and it&#39;s focus on Michael.<br/><br/>The main weakness comes in the characters.  Would Michael really go straight just to get his family back  and how come he managed to do it so easily up till the time of the film?  Worse still is Connie who seems to have become some sort of Mafia widow when that was not part of her character in the previous films  would she really have got that twisted or influential? Little problems like these just bugged me and they also fed into the performances.<br/><br/>For such a great cast the acting was very average.  Pacino is good but I sensed he didn&#39;t see Michael turning out this way and he didn&#39;t convince occasionally.  Keaton has little to do and again I felt that her approach to Michael was too forgiving, although maybe I&#39;m not allowing for time.  As I Siad before Shire was doing some sort of `Bride of Frankenstein&#39; act as Connie and I didn&#39;t buy it for a moment.  Garcia was OK and faces like Wallach, Hamilton and the like helped.  The two worst performances were sadly two of the main ones.  First Joe Mantegna..now it wasn&#39;t that it was bad  it was more that I&#39;ve seen him do so much better.  Here all I could think of when I watched him was how his character and his acting was very like his Simpsons&#39; character of ` Fat Tony&#39;.  Bare in mind Fat Tony is meant to be a spoof of the Mafioso characters and you&#39;ll see why I didn&#39;t like it.<br/><br/>The worse performance was Sofia Coppola.  Now she was vilified at the time for her role  a bit unfairly and cruelly but she was still bad.  She has this strange scowl on her face for most of the film and she acts like a spoil little girl.  She also has no realism in her voice and speaks in the same constant tone  that Vincent would fall for her was just a leap of faith too far to accept.  The cast does have others who are unused or underused  Fonda being the best example.  Why did she bother with that role!?<br/><br/>Overall, this is miles behind the other two Godfathers and it has plenty of weaknesses.  However at it&#39;s heart it&#39;s a good try as the concluding part and the story is watchable.  It&#39;s not bad, it just is average and it feels like the director and large sections of the cast felt they just had to turn up to make a third classic film.",198,61

This final installment of the greatest trilogy ever made is misunderstood by most because they do not see what this film is really about. G3 is  not about hits and gangland killings, but rather, G3 is about the end of Michael Corleone&#39;s legacy of crime in America. This movie shows him stepping out of the gambling and the other rackets because they have hurt him so badly. This movie is a masterpiece because it shows the conclusion to an incredible story. There had to be an end to this trilogy and this thoughtful way to do it exemplified the trilogy as an unbeatable one. Just because it doesn&#39;t end with a violent scene like the murder of the heads of the 5 families does not make it a bad movie, but in this case, a beautiful one. Please, don&#39;t feel you have to agree with the common view by proxy, but think on your own about what this movie really means and how it concludes and consequences the first two.",186,66

tt0099674,rw0282115,nuferjer,1,2001-06-14,"The Godfather Part I was a stunning look inside the fictional Corleone family and how an innocent young man was all but forced into circumstances he never wanted to have a part of. The Godfather Part II shows that young man&#39;s acceptance of his new role, his desensitization of character, as well as his complete loss of all innocence as he dives deeper and deeper into a life of crime. The first two parts of this saga of this transformation of Michael Corleone make for one of the greatest tragedies in cinematic history.<br/><br/>Then, along came The Godfather Part III. Michael Corleone is now the aging Don of the Corleone family. He shows remorse for his previous actions not through subtle behaviors, but by trying to use his powers for good and admitting all his wrongdoings and regrets to others. Very cliche and uncharacteristic of the complex character that is Michael Corleone. Michael&#39;s plans to use his powers for good are derailed by an ambitious young disciple and his enemies. Michael&#39;s daughter is eventually a casualty of the ongoing mob wars and her death predictably leads to Michael realizing that his entire life as Don has been worthless for he has failed in the one thing that was the reason for putting himself into the position he was in: protecting his family.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II ends with Michael Corleone reaching the lowest of the lows: having his own brother killed. Before Part III was made, the Godfather saga was an emotionally riveting tale of an innocent young man&#39;s journey into darkness with the unbelievably tragic end of Michael forgetting his roots and abandoning the one thing that has always mattered most to him and those around him: family loyalty. Part III paints the picture of Michael as a man who is and always has been just a victim of circumstance. This greatly corrupts the meaning of the first two films.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part III is a horrible mess of a film that never should have been made. The only solution to the problem that is this final installment of The Godfather movies is to pretend that it does not exist and that the saga actually ends with Michael&#39;s shockingly horrible act of having a member of his own family killed.",148,92
tt0099674,rw2536715,revival05,6,2011-12-23,"Being an optimistic fellow I wanted to enjoy The Godfather Part III the first time I saw it - this was easy, since its a competent piece of film making, generally well paced, acted, it&#39;s coherent, Al Pacino&#39;s in it, Coppola has made this film from A to Z and on its own terms the film doesn&#39;t have any inexcusable flaws. (Not even, I might add, the notorious Sofia Coppola; she&#39;s bad, but her performance is benefited by the character she&#39;s playing, which is also weak). So for a long time I was one of those guys going &quot;Hey, Godfather part III isn&#39;t as bad as everyone says. Sure, its not as good as the first two but not many movies are!&quot; Later in life, presumably with heightened standards and a better sense of criticism, I started to suspect that the opposite could be true - that part III was really nowhere near as good as I&#39;d recall - and after seeing all three films pretty much back to back I have to be honest (an approach I think wouldn&#39;t hurt the more enthusiastic defenders of this film) and conclude that The Godfather Part III, despite certain qualities, simply doesn&#39;t work.<br/><br/>(Excluded passage due to word limit; concerning how Coppola did the film for the money, and that it actually makes the film a little easier to appreciate)<br/><br/>I think the film really, on a whole, is perhaps not &#39;bad&#39;, certainly not horrible, but definitely a failure. The plot is underdeveloped and not engaging - Michael Corleone suffers from guilt. Its not unreasonable to say he did that at the end of Part II already. Where does his search for redemption lead him? Do &quot;they&quot; really pull him in again? Does his character do or say anything really memorable? Once or twice. But the script really is a long filler-session. And while everybody seems to just automatically praise Pacino because, well, he&#39;s Pacino I don&#39;t think his performance in this film is particularly good either, at least not by his merits. He&#39;s a great actor, and this is as fine a performance as any other he&#39;s made, but when you consider how truly versatile Pacino can be (compare Godfather part II with Scarface, with Serpico, Devil&#39;s Advocate, you name it, he&#39;s right there in character) its a disappointment that the aged Michael Corleone has turned into... well, Al Pacino. Obviously the character is not the same man that he used to be, but I never once really believed that I was watching Michael Corleone. He looked, and acted, too much like Al Pacino.<br/><br/>Not to mention Andy Garcia being nothing more than Andy Garcia, Joe Pantanglio, Eli Wallach, Talia Shire in a strangely awful performance (she&#39;s not a bad actress at all, but whatever happened here?). And of course Sofia Coppola; she isn&#39;t the crucial problem, but in the end she does become responsible for a lot of misfiring. The only one still doing a prime job is Diane Keaton as Kay - truly an unsung hero in these films, and to me one of the main reasons the drama work - and the film&#39;s best scenes were the one&#39;s she shared with Pacino. Why? Because then I felt like I was even watching a Godfather movie.<br/><br/>Much of everything else simply doesn&#39;t work. Whereas the original films were subtle and ambiguous, part III filters the story with melodramatic punches that are un-inspired and obvious. Michael&#39;s son, played by Franc D&#39;Ambrosio, seems taken from Days of Our Lives and so many of the questions we ask ourselves - what does he remember from his childhood? What does any of the characters feel about Michael&#39;s marriage in Sicily? Did Tom Hagen ever move to Las Vegas? etc - are left completely by the road, as if Coppola truly isn&#39;t interested in telling this story. There are instead near-insulting reminders to the audience that the other two movies still exist (like the pointless scene where Michael have kept the drawing Anthony left at his pillow when he was nine or so; &quot;I remember this&quot; he smiles, though I&#39;m not sure if we are to understand this as &quot;I also remember they shot up the bedroom that same night&quot;; once again, it seems Coppola simply forgets his own story). There are also awkward attempts at creating dramatic highlights in line with the horse-head scene and that very shooting in the beginning of Part II, involving a shooting during a parade in Little Italy and a stupid and ugly scene involving a helicopter. Making a Godfather sequel formulaic is truly a depressing insult to the originality of the first two films. The attempts Coppola takes on the Vatican are also pretty flat when you think about how Italian cinema has been doing this for half a century.<br/><br/>There&#39;s no reason to watch this film have you not seen the first two. And there&#39;s really no reason to watch it if you have seen them either. When you think about it, I don&#39;t see why the film&#39;s few merits are worth talking about. Movie newbies having seen Part I and II will naturally see III too, and I think many of them will come to the same conclusion. It&#39;s not all bad, but so what. It simply doesn&#39;t work very well.",171,53
tt0099674,rw0282195,MovieAddict2016,8,2003-09-15,"&quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; isn&#39;t really a necessary sequel, and to be truthful it&#39;s not really one of the best sequels in recent memory, but is it a bad film? No. In fact, had it not been for the extraordinary first two films, I firmly believe this movie would have been hailed as an epic; but due to such a broad expanse of years from the second film (1974) to this one (1990), audiences were given too much time to work up extreme expectations, especially with the major success of the first sequel. Many people just expected another equal sequel. It&#39;s just a good sequel.<br/><br/>Al Pacino returns to his role of Don Michael Corleone, much older since we last saw him and with a daughter (Sofia Coppola, Francis&#39; daughter). He is still split from his (ex)-wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) has since passed to the other side, though rumors have it his character was originally in Ford and Mario Puzo&#39;s script, only to be dumped when Duvall turned down the script because he believed Pacino was getting too much attention. (Though I have my doubts over the accuracy of that rumor.)<br/><br/>Michael wants out of the Mafia. He wants to work legitimate. He&#39;s been trying to turn his business into legit dealings for a while now, and he realizes that the sins of his past will never completely go away. He decides to hand the reigns of power over to his ex-brother Fredo&#39;s son (Andy Garcia), a young, eager soul with energy and excitement. But things do not go so well. Michael tries to be a mentor to his trainee but it is a difficult task. Michael goes through turbulent times, not to mention that he must deal with his daughter falling in love with the future head of the family (they&#39;re cousins, which, when you think about it, is just plain nasty).<br/><br/>Michael tries to get his son interested in becoming the head of the family, but he will have no part of it. He is bent on becoming an opera singer, to turn from his family&#39;s past and ignore his father&#39;s pleads. Michael is left with some difficult choices, and we see that all the power in the world can&#39;t control the inevitable.<br/><br/>&quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; has its flaws. One of them is the casting of Michael&#39;s daughter with Coppola&#39;s daughter - she has, one might say, no acting ability whatsoever. Garcia is bright and talented, and fits the part he is playing. Pacino isn&#39;t quite as energetic and powerful as he was in the first two films, in fact he looks pretty tired here, but I believe that&#39;s the point.<br/><br/>Some people really hate this film. I thought it was quite good. It&#39;s a good continuation, though I do not hesitate to admit it could have been much better. The film seems a bit corny at times, and there are some bad casting choices, one of which I have already mentioned above. But it is an entertaining film, one that no &quot;Godfather&quot; fan should go without seeing. It&#39;s a worthy (hopefully) last installment, one that gives more of the same but still manages to hold the audience&#39;s interest.<br/><br/>There are rumors flying everywhere of yet another &quot;Godfather&quot; entry, but quite honestly I think it&#39;s a bad decision. They should leave the series as it is and move on to other projects. Puzo is dead. Coppola hasn&#39;t made a good film in years - heck, he hasn&#39;t even produced a good film in years. Al Pacino&#39;s character would be hard to bring back, and if you&#39;ve seen this film you know what I&#39;m talking about. A prequel would just be messy and unexplained, not to mention confusing. To follow Andy Garcia&#39;s character would seem pointless - some things should be left to our imagination. I doubt as to the importance of another sequel, as it would, at this point, just be a cash-in.<br/><br/>The script by Coppola and Puzo is interesting, but it seems too try a bit too hard to be an epic at times. It just serves as a reminder that this film was not needed as an intallment in the series. &quot;The Godfather Part&quot; was great, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; was superb, &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; is probably the best film of 1990. Which, looking back at twenty years from now, probably won&#39;t amount to a hill of beans. But it&#39;s a start.<br/><br/>4.5/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer",130,70
tt0099674,rw0282112,Howlin Wolf,8,2001-05-15,"Castigate me if you will for saying this, but I believe part 3 to be the best of the series.  It&#39;s a very close run thing, with each film receiving the same rating from me (8), but it benefits from being a more intense study of ONE character rather than trying to divide its time between several, as the other two did.  That character of course is Michael Corleone; and when he&#39;s played by an actor of such class as Pacino, the movie can&#39;t fail. Michael has always been the most interesting character of the series for me, and is the fulcrum around which the entire series revolves; more so than Marlon Brando, who was nevertheless the first to essay the character of &#39;the Don&#39;.  It&#39;s fascinating to watch events unfold now that he is finally a willing head of the &#39;family&#39;, trying to emulate his father.<br/><br/>I did as is recommended and watched all 3 consecutively, so my ultimate preference for this one can&#39;t be explained by having forgotten how good the other two were.  IMO, this is a superior film on its own merits, which have nothing to do with the 15yr (I think) gap between sequels.<br/><br/>Andy Garcia is a great addition to the cast as the cocksure Vincent, and Sophia Coppola, despite what you may have heard, is fine here too as Mary.<br/><br/>She is also very beautiful.<br/><br/>The entire trilogy is a series which demands to be seen by all those who call themselves film fans, and the third is not a blight on the other two, but rather a quality addition that enriches far more than it detracts.",89,101
tt0099674,rw0282006,smaybee,1,2001-11-27,"-This movie is awful on two counts: as a finale to the trilogy and as a stand-alone film. This shows in the poor character development, the abundance of meaningless shots, and lastly, and most importantly in my mind, the meaninglessness of the dialogue. -All of the integrity of the characters from the first two Godfathers is completely done away with in the first sequence. -Michael, a taciturn, introverted, calculating megalomaniac in the first two films is lavish, loose-lipped, pathetic in his control over his family, and careless as he never was and never would have been by the first two movies. -Constanza is all of a sudden involved in the family affairs. Joe Mantegna plays a terribly thin enemy of the family, Joey Zasa, but can&#39;t be blamed as an actor with such a flimsy script. Andy Garcia overacts every one of Vincent Corleone&#39;s lines and every step--he practically goosesteps. Tom Hagan is missing and leaves a giant hole. It doesn&#39;t matter that Sofia Coppola can&#39;t act, because she had nothing to work with anyway--she plays a whinging, incestuous brat poorly, but convincingly (!). -The first dramatic sequence involves a conflict between Joey Zasa and Vincent mediated by Michael, who is trying to go legit, but can&#39;t seem to do it. Vincent tries to convince Michael that Zasa is &quot;an enemy&quot; in a very un-Godfatherly manner: a) he does it right in front of Zasa, b) he does so simply because Zasa supposedly says, &quot;F*ck Michael Corleone,&quot; behind his back, and c) he disobeys Michael right in the room by biting Zasa&#39;s ear off. -This is juvenile drama. There is no tension that lasts longer than a sequence. There is no reason motivating the characters. There is no real respect for anything--all the subtleties of the family traditions are stomped on, which makes the highly visual sequences, loaded with symbols, cheap because the symbols mean nothing to the characters. -The haughty diction is only pretension void of any understanding of respect and the values that drive the family and Michael in particular. Michael, a very chiseled character in the first two movies, becomes paper thin, with no real idea that is central to his action. All his actions in the first movie and the facades he puts on as Don in the second movie show an aspiration to an ideal or, at least, an aspiration to appear as this ideal. He has none of this in the third film and this change of character doesn&#39;t happen on screen, nor is it explained. We&#39;re left only to believe that Coppola and Puzo tore this one off in a frenzied weekend when the purse got light. -The story lacks direction, focus, has nothing in particular to say, but that&#39;s not condemnable unto itself. The dialogue, however, is worthy of a pair of misguided high school kids who watched the first two movies and figured they knew what respect was because they saw one guy shoot another and a bunch of people get scared. None of the dialogue is loaded with the layers of meaning and subtlety that exist in the first two. All the characters are brash and stereotypical, or, in the case of a few, like Enzo the Baker and Bridget Fonda&#39;s character, tokens and a waste of celluloid. -Though Godfather III isn&#39;t worth its score in Scrabble, it is, however, a testament to Pacino as an actor, that with such flimsy stuff he still manages to act compellingly.",108,77
tt0099674,rw2273593,rbarnes-1,3,2010-07-04,"Many of the reviews of this seem too positive. The movie was deeply flawed and love for the early Godfather films should not blind us to the fiasco that was number 3. <br/><br/>Casting problems: Diane Keaton said all she needed to say in part 2. Her presence in the part 3 added nothing whatsoever. We learn from her dialog that she will always love Michael but that she will never accept his gangster ways. Yeah. We learned that in part 2. George Hamilton as the lawyer/confident. Lame. Sophia Coppola as Mary. She comes across like a dull-witted 16-year-old that doesn&#39;t know a thing about acting but thinks it is fun to be able to stand in front of a camera. (spoiler alert) the primary dramatic event of the movie involved her death. By that time I was hoping that she would be killed off (or at least get no more screen time), so my ability to feel any emotional impact at the death of this air-headed monstrosity.<br/><br/>Dialog problems: The dialog in Michael&#39;s study in the initial scene is painful to hear. The movie gets better, but very awkward dialog pops up every 20 minutes or so throughout the movie. Part of the problem is the screen play and part of the problem is that at times the actors don&#39;t know how to effectively deliver their lines.<br/><br/>Plot problems: Awkward casting &amp; dialog aside, I think this is the biggest problem. when you get to be one of the wealthiest business men in the world, wacking people no longer makes any sense. When you have untold millions at your disposal, you find that you a wide range of tools to accomplish your aims, and most of these tools work better than bullets (anyone remember the last time a Fortune 500 CEO was taken out in a mob hit?). (spoiler alert) There is a scene in which one of the baddies flies a helicopter outside a penthouse ballroom in a high rise building and then occupants of the helicopter riddle the ballroom with machine gun fire killing dozens of wealthy business men. This would be par for the course in the Matrix, or True Lies, or Commando, but this type of violence is not part of the real world we live in. It&#39;s cartoonishness is at odds with the other Godfather films and makes it difficult to take this film seriously. As well paced and tense as the final opera house scene was, it was also in the category of cartooney violence. Did the best assassin in all of Italy really think the cleverest way to kill one of the richest men on the planet was to slip into a well guarded public place, kill off a bunch of hired body guards and then shoot a man in front of 1000 witnesses? Well, I guess the screenwriter thought so. The end result was a complete mess. The narrative flow of the final film was a train wreck. The plot elements went back from somewhat believable to overblown Hollywood insanity and back again.",124,59
tt0099674,rw2041532,johnmichael-2,3,2009-03-22,"Near the beginning of &quot;The Godfather: Part III,&quot; Michael Corleone&#39;s son wants to drop out of law school and become a musician. Michael Corleone does not want this. But his estranged ex-wife, Kay, manages to convince him to let Anthony Corleone pursue music as he wishes. So he does.<br/><br/>That seems like an odd way to start a review, as it is a minor plot point and has nothing really to do with the major action. Just bear with me here; you&#39;ll see where I&#39;m going with this eventually. Now let me tell you about the major plot. It is about Michael Corleone wanting to quit crime for good (he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business). But then along comes Vincent Mancini, an illegitimate nephew, who is involved in a feud. So of course Michael must endure yet another brush with criminality and gun violence and all that good gangster stuff. Meanwhile, Vincent has a semi-incestuous affair with Michael&#39;s daughter Mary. Oh, and Michael and Kay are trying to patch up all the horrid things that happened at the end of Part II.<br/><br/>It is like a soap opera. One horrid, awful, 169-minute soap opera. Gone is any sort of the sophistication, romance, and emotional relevance that made the first two movies hit home so hard. After a 16-year break in the franchise, Francis Ford Coppola delivered a mess of sop and pretentiousness entirely incongruous with the first two films, once again proving his last great work was &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; back in the 1970&#39;s.<br/><br/>What&#39;s worse, &quot;The Godfather: Part III&quot; isn&#39;t even a logical follow-up of &quot;The Godfather: Part II.&quot; Michael is a completely different person. He hasn&#39;t just gone to seed (which might be legitimate, even if it&#39;d be no fun to watch). He&#39;s become a goody-goody that&#39;s trying to fix all the tragedy that made Part II such a devastating masterpiece. His confession to the priest was bad enough, but that little diabetes attack in the middle pushed it over to nauseating. He also gets back together with Kay! For heaven&#39;s sakes, there is absolutely no way that should happen, as the 2nd movie made abundantly clear! She aborted his baby, and his Sicilian upbringing made him despise her for it. Didn&#39;t Francis Ford Coppola even think of these things?<br/><br/>And don&#39;t even get me started on Mary and Vincent&#39;s affair! For a romance so forbidden, it was shockingly unengaging. Sofia Coppola&#39;s acting did nothing to help. She made the smartest move of her life when she switched from in front of the camera to behind it, because she was possibly THE worst actress I have ever seen in a Best Picture nominee. Every line she delivered was painfully memorized, and every time the drama rested on her acting abilities, all she elicited was inappropriate giggles. In the climactic scene--I won&#39;t go into detail, but you&#39;ll know which scene I&#39;m talking about when/if you watch it--she looks at Michael and says, &quot;......Daddy?&quot; I think I was meant to cry, but the line was delivered so poorly I burst out into long, loud laughter!<br/><br/>Now we get to the climax, and now you will also realize why I took time to start the review with a description of Anthony Corleone&#39;s musical ambitions. After 140 minutes of petty drama and irrelevant happenstances, Anthony Corleone returns... with an opera! So Michael, Kay, Mary, and Vincent go to see it, and for about 10-15 minutes a couple killers walk around trying to assassinate Michael. About this climactic sequence, I must say one thing: It was really good! But not because of the killers--they were pretty boring. I just really liked the opera. It had some great music and real great set pieces. And, from what little it showed us, it seemed that the story had echoes of the Corleone family&#39;s origin. I&#39;ll bet it was one swell opera, and I&#39;ll bet Michael Corleone was glad he let his son switch from law school to music.<br/><br/>My biggest wish is this: that Francis Ford Coppola had merely filmed Anthony Corleone&#39;s opera for 169 minutes and ditched the rest of the soggy melodrama. Better yet, I wish he hadn&#39;t made &quot;The Godfather: Part III&quot; at all. Part II gave us the perfect ending. This spin off was self-indulgent and unnecessary.<br/><br/>P.S. This is not a gut reaction to the film. I watched all 3 Godfather films over a month ago (though I was rewatching the first one). Not only does this mean that my expectations for Part III weren&#39;t screwed (in fact, I had set the bar rather low for it after what I heard), but it also means I&#39;ve had a good time to think about all three films. While I was a bit disappointed with Part II at first, the more I thought about it, the better it seemed. But with Part III, it was bad to begin with, then got worse the more I thought about it. The sad thing is that many people will stop with Part I, but if they watch Part II as well, they will most likely go on to Part III. If you have the will, watch Parts I &amp; II and pretend like Part III never existed.",102,59

In her performance she set out to play one of the innocent children of Al Pacino. <br/><br/>There&#39;s a moving scene in The Godfather where we saw Al Pacino and Marlon Brando talking for the last time. Brando&#39;s hopes were for his son to become Governor Corleone, Senator Corleone to attain that level of respectability that was out of the Don&#39;s reach. Pacino tells him, maybe the next generation.<br/><br/>Flash forward to the late seventies where Pacino has slowly divested himself of the illegal interests of the Corleone family. But the other crime bosses don&#39;t like the idea of him going completely legitimate. He also has some opposition within his own family. His surviving sibling Talia Shire thinks he ought to keep a hand in and his illegitimate nephew, Andy Garcia is having a running feud with another family head, Joe Mantegna.<br/><br/>Andy Garcia got the only acting nomination for The Godfather: Part III as Sonny&#39;s son out of wedlock. And he&#39;s every bit as wild and hot tempered as Sonny was from The Godfather. Garcia brings a lot of passion to the part. But he does prove able to learn from his uncle and eventually not repeat the mistakes of his father. Garcia lost to another hoodlum portrayal, Joe Pesci for Goodfellas for Best Suppporting Actor.<br/><br/>Probably Al Pacino has gotten all he could out of the character of Michael Corleone. He&#39;s gotten real respectability now, he&#39;s been conferred with a Papal Knightship for the good works of the Corleone Foundation now. He&#39;s high up the criminal world too. But people and circumstances won&#39;t let those worlds mix and as he ruefully remarks, &quot;just when I think I&#39;m out, they drag me back in again.&quot;<br/><br/>Only four characters made it through the three Godfather films, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Richard Bright as Al Neri. All except Neri seem to grow in character, Neri is still button man in chief since Lucabrazzi started sleeping with the fishes in The Godfather. Keaton&#39;s character is still the outsider. Separated from Pacino in The Godfather: Part II, she still loves him and regrets as much as he has the outside forces that caused their separation.<br/><br/>Although Talia Shire got an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress in The Godfather: Part II, I think she really comes into her own in this one. Had it not been for male chauvinism implicit in the Sicilian culture, she&#39;d be taking over the family business from Pacino. She&#39;s changed so dramatically over the course of the three films. In The Godfather she&#39;s the innocent daughter about to embark on marriage to a wife beater. In The Godfather: Part II, she&#39;s now entering middle age, overindulging in excesses, unhappy as a many time married widow, her first husband being killed in the original Godfather. She lives on the sufferance and tolerance of her brother. Now in The Godfather: Part III she takes an active interest in the family business and the family legacy. She realizes more than Pacino there&#39;s no escaping the Corleone roots. She champions Garcia as the new Don, she knows he&#39;s got the chops for the job, she hopes he can develop the smarts as does Pacino.<br/><br/>Eli Wallach contributes a fine performance as another aging crime Don who&#39;s got a lot more to him than when we first meet him. Raf Vallone plays Pope John Paul I and the urban legend of his sudden demise after a one month papacy is woven into the Corleone story. As is Joe Mantegna who plays an undisguised version of Brooklyn mob boss Joe Columbo.<br/><br/>I&#39;m sure if the money&#39;s right and a workable screenplay is developed we may not have seen the last of the Corleones. There was one talked about a few years ago. Still if it never develops, The Godfather: Part III is a fine film to end the saga.",80,45
tt0099674,rw1081418,BrandtSponseller,9,2005-05-16,"Series note: It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather, Part II (1974) first. This is a direct continuation of that story.<br/><br/>I suppose that if I do not love being a contrarian, I do not love anything, but it&#39;s not that I set out to be contrarian for its own sake. It just happens when I&#39;m honest about my tastes and views. My latest flourish of contrarianism is that I think The Godfather, Part III is just as good as The Godfather, Part II, even though it&#39;s a quite different film, loaded with conspicuously different messages. And although most of Part III&#39;s scenes, except the extended climax, never quite reach the sublime excellence of much of Part II, Part III doesn&#39;t have near the flaws, either. Both films ended up being a 9 out of 10 for me, or a low &quot;A&quot;.<br/><br/>Part III is all about Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) seeking redemption and forgiveness. We see him haunted by one of the stronger, more shocking moments from Part II. And so he has decided to sincerely go &quot;legit&quot;, while getting back to his roots, trying to regain what he has lost and maybe even &quot;redo&quot; the mistakes he has made. Thus he heads back to New York and eventually back to Sicily. In the opening party scene we see him even trying to make amends with his ex-wife Kay (Diane Keaton). The most important plot points all have to do with Michael learning to compromise and even let go of some control. The most tragic elements of the film are rooted in the things for which he has difficulty relinquishing control, and we feel a much more &quot;real&quot; threat to Michael&#39;s safety because of the unintentional losses of control that he experiences.<br/><br/>Of course, the irony ends up being that the &quot;legit&quot; world is just as corrupt, if not more so, as the world he&#39;s trying to redeem himself from. Michael is &quot;forced&quot; to resort to his old modus operandi if he wants to participate, survive and succeed. Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo thus create something of a classical tragedy, with a pessimistic message about human relations; one that also suggests a reinterpretation of the previous two Godfather films as metaphors for socio-economic machinations in general--not just a soap-operatic tale of a powerful Mafia family.<br/><br/>Unlike The Godfather and Part II, Coppola remains tightly focused on his principal themes here. Even though the film seems almost as sprawling as the previous two on first glance, and it suffers slightly from also having a bloated cast, in retrospect, there is nothing present in Part III that isn&#39;t meant to be tied in with the subtexts. Even seemingly inconsequential scenes, such as Michael and Kay encountering the marionette show, provide artistic, literary connections to significant plot points. In this case the scene provides both foreshadowing and metaphor for the most substantial element of the climax.<br/><br/>By the way, it&#39;s interesting to note that Coppola introduces somewhat erotic (though very tame) scenes for the first time here (that&#39;s not to say that past Godfather films didn&#39;t suggest romances or sex, but they weren&#39;t really erotic). Surprisingly, perhaps, the chief erotic scenes involve his daughter, Sofia, who is shown in a relationship as close to incestuous as possible without being incestuous, and who also has an unpleasant fate in the film. When we also remind ourselves of the filmic treatment that director Dario Argento subjected his daughter, Asia, and his significant other, Daria Nicolodi, to over the years, it might make us want to psychoanalyze Italian filmmakers, but it&#39;s helpful to remember that initially, Sofia Coppola&#39;s role was to be played by Winona Ryder, who was too sick at the time to begin shooting.<br/><br/>The cast in Part III is sometimes cited as one of the reasons for its inferiority, but despite the relative shortage of megastars, I think the cast, including Sofia, is fantastic here. Godfather newcomer Andy Garcia was particularly impressive.<br/><br/>Coppola again uses Part I for a structural template, just as he did in Part II, but he tries to throw in subtle variations and even red herrings. Like its predecessors, Part III begins with a party celebrating an important familial event related to religious ceremonies wherein we meet the principal players, the middle section deals with similar business dilemmas mixed with betrayals, double crossings and their consequences, and the ending parallels a major shakedown involving multiple parties with some other important familial event imbued with ritual/ceremony (the parallel was slightly different in Part II).<br/><br/>The subtle variations here involve what could be called &quot;tags&quot;. For example, the beginning puts us in a more formal religious ceremony before we move to the party, and the ending has a tag that could be one of the most ingenious transitions/scenes that Coppola has written. We move from a profoundly tragic event to a point much later in time. Not one word of dialogue is spoken. Through mere appearance of character and setting, plus the final, sad event, there is as much &quot;said&quot; or implied in one elegant minute as there was in the entire film up to that point--although what preceded was necessary for the pithy implicature.<br/><br/>The technical elements, though good here, cannot quite match those of Parts I and II. This may be more surprising when we realize that the same people worked on both films in many capacities, but it just underscores that elements such as the intense, unusual, deeply lit scenes of Part II, for example, happened as much by a &quot;magic&quot; confluence of events as they happened intentionally, which may be why no one has quite been able to capture that look again, including here. On the other hand, even though the music is excellent in all three films, for my money, it might be best integrated in Part III, especially the melancholy theme that periodically recurs.",85,39
tt0099674,rw5505362,0U,,2020-02-24,"Definitely not my favorite of the 3 but it&#39;s hard when the first 2 were just that good. It still portrays well, from my historical knowledge, much of the struggle of the mob families to legitimize their business dealings and try to enjoy life in the later age of the mafia in America. Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films.",92,31
tt0099674,rw0282043,fadeout,1,1999-06-22,"On its own, this film would be merely mediocre.  But in contrast to Godfather I and II, and as a film marketed as part of a trilogy, it is a travesty.  From the vanity casting of Sophia Coppola, to the stupefyingly boring subplot of the Vatican banking scandal, to the all-sunshiney cinematography, to the sophomoric references to King Lear, it is on a much lower plane than Coppola&#39;s earlier films.  The boxed set is like getting Citizen Kane, Chinatown and Porky&#39;s III as a trilogy.  Not to mention the fact that the beginning of Godfather III is inconsistent with the ending of Godfather II. The recent news story that a Godfather IV is in the offing is, after the invasion of Kosovo, the worst news I&#39;ve heard this year.",72,51
tt0099674,rw0282058,BigDog-18,,1999-10-05,"I recently watched all three Godfather films again in sequence and was surprised at how bad GF III is when closely compared to the other two fims. There are characters in the film whose presence is never made clear (i.e. George Hamilton, Brigette Fonda and Don Novello - Father Guido Sarducci??) The major characters bear little resemblance to themselves from the previous films. Connie Corleone is now a major supporter of Michael even though she knows he had her husband killed? Michael now has a change of heart and tries to go &quot;legit&quot; even though he so eagerly immersed himself into the power and control of the Corleone family. And Kay continues to &quot;hang around&quot; even though she dreads Michael and all that he stands for. Why?? The movie drags on in parts and never really gains it&#39;s true identity untill the end of the film during the opera scene. Not even Winona Ryder who was scheduled to be cast in the part of Mary could have helped. It only serves to give us an appetite for the earlier two films. Both of which I consider masterpieces.",84,37
tt0099674,rw3246637,rmax304823,5,2015-05-28,"Coppola really didn&#39;t want to make this movie but the studio prodded him and provided a lavish budget so he took another stab at it. However, he was now unable to get the cast he wanted. Duvall asked for too much money, so the role of consiglieri was reduced to that of George Hamilton&#39;s infrequent appearance as a plain legal adviser. Coppola could now shoot on various locations without fear of being fired but it was no longer The Family he&#39;d been so proud of.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t really have too much to say about this venture. It&#39;s a little sad. Coppola is a sensitive family man. He loves babies. And he blames critics for condemning the movie because he cast his daughter. I don&#39;t know whether he&#39;s right or not. She looks proper for the part of the virginal Italian girl, not exotic or spectacularly beautiful but innocent. Her performance is hard to judge from one role. She comes across as natural rather than as a seasoned actress. It fits her role but it&#39;s hard to tell what her range might be. Diane Keaton was available, probably because not many parts were coming her way, but there is no spark between her and Pacino, just a wan regret without moment.<br/><br/>But Coppola is wrong in believing that the movie failed because of Sofia. The movie failed because it was a watered-down and meandering story that seemed without point. The material -- Al Pacino, his family relationships and his intrigues -- is no longer fresh. There is no novelty in it.<br/><br/>And sometimes it seems as if the elements that are important to the director are more personal than portentous. He may find it shocking that a newly elected Pope could be assassinated. I doubt that most people care as much as he does, especially since we hardly get to know Raf Vallone. The whole Vatican provides not much more than a backdrop for colorfully robed figures having business meetings and enacting rituals.<br/><br/>I&#39;m happy for Coppola that he was able to cast his father as the local band leader in Sicily. And I like Coppola&#39;s personality. He&#39;s growing wine now in Napa or somewhere. And when I lived in San Francisco he owned a small underground restaurant, Tomasso&#39;s, where the customers waiting for a table could tap the wine barrel in the dark, tiny room as often as they liked and get half lit during their wait. The wait was worth while. The clams cuscus were a rarely encountered treat.<br/><br/>I wish I could recommend the movie as highly as the restaurant.",68,41
tt0099674,rw4241437,dvkatzprod-74759,8,2018-07-16,"I finally saw it ! As a total devotee of the two previous installments, I avoided seeing the third one, on purpose, people I respect had told me about the disappointment and, quite honestly, I didn&#39;t go there. Last night I did and surprise, surprise, it moved me no end. Maybe because I haven&#39;t seen the other two in four years. Yes at times is more Ken Russell than Francis Ford Coppola and in my book that&#39;s not a bad thing. I was, however, a bit taken aback by the healing in Pacino&#39;s Michael as far as Keaton&#39;s Kay is concerned. As it nothing had ever happened, while in Diane Keaton the memory of that pain is always present. Talia Shire is a lot of fun as a sort of Madame Sin. Raf Vallone, superb as the doomed Pope John Paul I and then a bit puzzling casting choices that I think they me code for something. George Hamilton, for instance, takes over from where Rubert Duvall left off. Helmut Berger plays the head of the Vatican Bank. Helmut Berger! Just as curious as to find Troy Donahue in The Godfather Part II - All in all, I&#39;m really glad I&#39;ve seen it and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll see it again.",74,28
tt0099674,rw2431134,ElMaruecan82,8,2011-05-20,"It&#39;s funny how some personal circumstances are the key elements that influence our judgment. In my case, &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, was not the last opus of a magnificent saga, but the first film I watched from the trilogy, my first encounter with the Corleone Family, a cinematic love story that would never end.<br/><br/>Speaking of love, I always wondered how a movie like &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; had crystallized so much hatred and disdain. The unforgettable &quot;Never hate your enemies, because it clouds your judgment&quot; is like a self-defense cry, from a film that wanted so much to be respected like its glorious predecessors, but apparently failed to, for even the fans will always concede after they say how the movie is great  &quot;but not as great as the two others&quot; <br/><br/>So, as a fourteen-year old kid, I loved &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, I couldn&#39;t complain about the absence of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. I wasn&#39;t mature enough to judge Sofia Coppola&#39;s acting abilities though I found something physically odd in her. From Michael&#39;s relationship with Kay to his haircut, &quot;Part III&quot; was my reference. And I guess I loved the movie for what it was: a great story with an unforgettable climax.<br/><br/>Till now, I can&#39;t watch the ending, even the clip, without crying, it broke my heart the first time, and it always does, even after so many viewings. It was like I felt the devastation of a man whose life&#39;s only meaning was incarnated by his children, his only inspiration in his quest of redemption. And it&#39;s ironically the very part that kind of redeems the film, even for the non fans. The others deserving to be mentioned are Michael Corleone&#39;s sadness while hearing the &#39;Brucia La Terra&#39; song played by his son, and his heart-breaking confession of Fredo&#39;s murder  <br/><br/>The film is about the redemption of a man who sinned so many times. Many would argue that his sins were necessary because they were the only ways to maintain the interests of his family, but hell is paved with many good intentions, and the way Michael ended at &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, a ruthless cold-blooded zombie-like figure was demanding a sequel. The last shot of him, sitting alone in the park plunged viewers in a lot of interrogations and interpretations. What was he thinking? Probably, how he got in such a situation, and how this would end. And it&#39;s like Coppola, tortured by his own demons, felt there was more to do with Michael Corleone.<br/><br/>And the character&#39;s arc was concluded, with nothing I would reproach in Michael&#39;s portrayal, he&#39;s tired, sick as he had carried the weight of a lifelong guilt that ravaged his soul. He may be too pathetic, too different from the Michael we know,his use of profanity was quite out-of character, but who knows how killing his own brother could affect someone. Michael is still respected and feared, but is more melancholic, explaining how the movie needed to be driven by more active supporting characters. And after I finally watched the two other films, one year later  my opinions were mixed.<br/><br/>First, I was fascinated by the sight of young War hero, Michael Corleone, in Connie&#39;s wedding, it was so contrasting with the pitiful diabetic Mike of the third opus, watching Part I was an extraordinary discovery, a refreshing experience. Besides, the gallery of new characters, Sonny, Tom, Clemenza, Tessio, enriched the film and made it even more entertaining, Part II confirmed my fascination. And step by step, when I started to watch the first two a little more and while I was sharing my opinions on the Net and learning about Part III&#39;s reputation, flaws were becoming more visible: Sofia, Duvall&#39;s absence and replacement by that Hamilton guy who was certainly not to Hagen what Pentangelli was to Clemenza, the helicopter scene etc. And the reading of the book made me wonder why they chose as the successor, Sonny&#39;s illegitimate son.<br/><br/>But if the film could have been better, it also could have been worse. And when I watch it, I&#39;m more generous, as I see the tragic ending of one of the most fascinating character&#39;s story, a man who&#39;s always been &quot;pulled back in&quot;. The movie respects the spirit of Part I, with a succession on the Corleone&#39;s throne, true historical events as back-stories, and so many unforgettable lines. In fact, we can make a parallel between the trilogy and the Corleone brothers: <br/><br/><ul><li>The Godfather is like Sonny : fierce, brutal, yet tender and good-hearted, it&#39;s entertaining and deep in the same time. And we all just love &#39;Sonny&#39; ...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Godfather Part II is Michael : deeper, darker, smoother, yes, even &#39;boring&#39; sometimes, but it&#39;s more implacable and ruthless ... we can&#39;t love it with the same intensity as the first opus, but we respect the cinematic achievement, and it leaves us with an extraordinary feeling. It&#39;s not the most entertaining, but certainly the most fascinating.</li></ul><br/><br/>And of course ...<br/><br/><ul><li>The Godfather Part III is Fredo : it tries too much, it has a good heart but it&#39;s weak and even sometimes &#39;stupid&#39; but hey, it&#39;s still a blood brother of the first two films, we still feel Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s touch and it features some heartbreaking moments, like Michael&#39;s silent scream that will haunt me forever. Some magnetism was lacking from the very start, but can we really hate &#39;Fredo&#39;? </li></ul><br/><br/>I&#39;m sure those who prefer the first film also appreciate the last one and those who love the second film and think it&#39;s the best one, identify so much with Michael that they hate &quot;Part III&quot;, with the same intensity and severity Michael expressed towards Fredo. They don&#39;t forgive any mistake ... and consider the last film a disgrace for the trilogy, and symbolically disown it.",89,13
tt0099674,rw1266990,Bob-562,1,2006-01-16,"Part III is dead in the water in every way. It&#39;s derivative in plot outline from the first two films; it has some awful acting stints by Pacino, Sophia Coppola, &amp; Talia Shire, among others; and it insults the Catholic Church by positing as truth the murder of a pope. Critics have been way too indulgent with this dog! The Godfather saga seemed appropriately concluded at the end of Part II, when we&#39;re left with a heartless Michael aging alone in his blustery Tahoe home. That haunting scene is jettisoned in Part III when we&#39;re re-introduced to a redeemed, conscience-stricken Michael. Also, Pacino was the master of understatement in the first two films, so that when he exploded, you took notice. In Part III, alas, he&#39;s still stuck in his shouting, out-of-control acting schtick (see &quot;Heat&quot; for more of that).<br/><br/>Supposedly the future shoplifting Winona Ryder bowed out of III: but why, oh why would Coppola replace her with his talentless daughter?

tt13130308,rw8591950,nidhunmoviebuff,7,2022-10-06,"When Prithviraj, the original director behind the hit Malayalam film &quot;Lucifer&quot; (2019), on which Godfather is based, was asked who he would pick from Tollywood to play the main character essayed by Mohanlal in the original, he was quick to point to Chiranjeevi. Perhaps no other actor has brought to screen larger-than-life massy heroes on screen than the legendary superstar, with mega-blockbusters like &quot;Mutha Mestri (1993)&quot; and &quot;Indra (2002)&quot; still revered by audiences. In that respect, Ram Charan pulled off a major coup in acquiring the remake rights of Lucifer, understanding that the role is tailor-made to play to his father&#39;s strengths.<br/><br/>The megastar plays &quot;Brahma&quot; an astute political operator and heir-apparent to the Chief Minister who passes away abrupts, leaving behind a power vacuum and a slew of political opportunists who want to make hay while the sun shines. The CM&#39;s son-in-law Jai (Satyadev) as well as the Home Minister, Verma (Murali Sharma) lead a faction that will stop at nothing to ensure Brahma doesn&#39;t grab power and the ensuing political machinations, treachery and violence form the rest of the story. Director Mohan Raja builds on the original source material rather than copying it frame by frame, delivering more mass elevation sequences suitable for the superstar he had at his disposal<br/><br/>The Performances<br/><br/>Given better writing and a more well-rounded character to essay, Chiranjeevi makes a rollicking comeback to the mass hero role, oozing all the gravitas and panache that was missing in misadventures like &quot;Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy (2019)&quot; and &quot;Acharya (2022)&quot;. Satyadev and Murali Sharma excel in their supporting roles while Nayantara shines in a nuanced, restrained performance as the beleaguered, troubled daughter of the CM. Salman Khan&#39;s cameo, however, sticks out like a sore thumb, delivering some of the most inept, laughably over-the-top action sequences in the film that spoil the intricate mind games that had made the film highly enjoyable up until that point.<br/><br/>Despite a final act laden with mind-bogglingly stupid and inane action sequences, Chiranjeevi&#39;s swag and style pull through the mayhem and ensure you leave the theatre hall satisfied. It is especially rewarding to see the megastar in his true element and with Ram Charan and the Konidela Production Company having secured the rights for other Malayalam hits like &quot;Driving License (2019)&quot; and reportedly even the magnum-opus &quot;Bheeshma Parvam (2022)&quot;, there will be more opportunities down the line for the superstar to shine, backed up by strong writing. &quot;Godfather&quot; is a fairly enjoyable watch in theatres, and will be a true treat for Chiranjeevi fans.",8,17

The political drama tweaked to appeal to Telugu audience has commendable writing to suit Megastar&#39;s persona. Brahma played by Chiranjeevi, is the protector of PKR&#39;s political party as well as family. After the death of the CM, his son-in-law Jaidev becomes the prime contender for the CM post overtaking the Home Minister (Murali Sharma). The only one standing tall stopping him is Brahma. Utilizing the family feud between Brahma &amp; Satya Priya (Nayanthara), daughter of PKR along with the corrupt party members, more hurdles is thrown at Brahma. How he overcomes all the hurdles and protects both the family as well as political party is rest of the story.<br/><br/>The first half is neat with enough clapworthy scenes and the best thing about them is how subtly these scenes are executed. After establishing the backstory to Brahma and PKR, the story focuses on the clash between Jaidev and Brahma. The character of Jaidev doesn&#39;t have much surprises as it is painted grey from the word go but Satyadev brought this character alive. The pace is good and with a pre-interval superbly execute scene followed by entry of another Megastar, it ends on a high note.<br/><br/>The second half however takes the easy route and resorts to crowd pleasing tactics. With not much twists and turns, the pace does feel hampered a bit but the timely re-entry of Masoom Bhai (Salman Khan) clarifies on the tone of rest of the film. From hereon, it is just fan frenzy stuff. Chiru gets another action scene early in the second half with the BGM from Bruce Lee being re-used and the amount of whistles I got to hear in my audi, there wasn&#39;t much to complain.<br/><br/>Among the performances, Chiranjeevi succeeds in delivering a restrained performance with him taking the backseat in much of the action (barring the 2 solo action scenes), the veteran aces the emotional scenes with Nayanthara. Satyadev excels as the baddie though the characterization could&#39;ve had more fizz. Nayanthara does well within the scope of her character. Salman Khan adds on to the megastardom and all of his scenes are designed to please the fans only. The Chiru - Salman scenes are indeed paisa vasool and Salman getting to mouth Telugu line was icing on the cake.<br/><br/>I would have rated this higher if the third act didn&#39;t resort to solely rely on Salman Khan - Chiranjeevi scenes to take the story to it&#39;s climax.

The De Niro scenes, out of context, are just repetitive and make little sense. The one bonus was getting to see the deleteds back when such opportunities were rare.

No one thought cinema could get any better. Fast forward a few years and Francis Ford Coppola is financially struggling to create his newest masterpiece, Apocalypse Now. A deal is struck where he is funded for his current project, but he has to re-edit the two Godfather films. It was a risky move that made Coppola into the Hollywood legend he is today.<br/><br/>There are several different versions of the edited films, most notably the one broadcast for television in 1977, which added a few deleted scenes, but also edited out any grotesque violence or language. It was a compromise that Coppola made, probably hoping for a theatrical re-release at some point in the future. The 1977 edit of the two films in chronological timeline order was a huge success, and the audience loved the films. I believe this is why Coppola decided to make The Godfather Part 3.<br/><br/>Well, part 3 came out, and it was panned by critics and the audience just wasn&#39;t there like they were nearly twenty years before. The films were again edited, but the audience still enjoyed the first two films far more than they did the third. Finally, the uncensored and reconstructed version of the first two films was released on cable in 2016 as the complete epic. That edit is the best one there is, with a running time of 7 hours and 3 minutes, including everything from the two movies and deleted scenes.

The film starts out with a young kid in 1953 Harlem who makes money giving shoe shines and gets involved in a mob hit and is told to take a package to a building to a bad cop named McKinney (Art Lund). McKinney accuses the kid of stealing money from him and is beaten badly until he has a broken leg. Fast forward to the mid 60&#39;s and young Tommy Gibbs (Fred Williamson) is now a grown man and executes a mob hit on his own and tells a mafioso named Cardoza (Val Avery) that he&#39;s responsible and wants in with the mob and just wants to run an area in Harlem. He rises in power and has some important log books with all the information on important people on the take. He has a girl named Helen (Gloria Hendry) but doesn&#39;t have the sophistication to keep her. Finally the mob decides to get rid of him and now he&#39;s the target! This film was directed by Larry Cohen (It&#39;s Alive!) who is a veteran of low budget efforts and the film is benefited by his experience. The film is actually shot on location in Harlem and in several shots you can see people staring at the camera. Also, the Apollo Theater is seen as the camera pans the street. While this is another version of &quot;Little Caesar&quot; there is an aspect of the story that I found very well handled and it was the scenes where Tommy Gibbs is feeling betrayed and alone. One scene in particular that stands out is at his mothers funeral and he asks his father if he&#39;s all right. What adds to these scenes is the effective use of music that helps establish the mood of the film and these scenes in particular. The music is by James Brown and Barry DeVorzon. Even with limited funds and some poorly dubbed dialogue can&#39;t detract from the emotions in parts of this film. Fred Williamson is a former football player and his acting experience was very limited so his performance is even more impressive to watch. The guy has natural charisma on screen but he also shows that he can bare his emotions like any good actor. If you like these types of films than this is one of the classics of its genre. As much fun as it was to watch Williamson smear shoe polish on Lund and make him sing &quot;Mammy&quot; the film has more to offer than that. The scenes of Williamson&#39;s character feeling alone and betrayed along with the good music score are what make this film stand out from the others of its kind. Classic exploitation.",33,4
tt0069792,rw1656125,preppy-3,5,2007-05-15,"Movie starts out in 1953 where we see young black Tommy Gibbs doing jobs for the mob. He starts developing his own little gang. As he gets older (and becomes Fred Williamson) he works his way into the white mob--even though they don&#39;t want &quot;ni**ers&quot; (as they say throughout the film). Then he steals some damaging ledgers and uses it to run crime in the city, help black people and keep the evil white people at bay. But the white guys in the mob aren&#39;t about to give up...<br/><br/>Perhaps I&#39;m not the best person to review a Larry Cohen movie--he&#39;s the producer, writer and director of this. I&#39;ve never liked any of his movies and he makes really bad low budget films (unlike Roger Corman who makes good ones). This one is full of goofs--I love it when you hear a baby crying on the soundtrack but you can clearly see that the baby isn&#39;t making a sound! This is full of bad dialogue and has a very predictable script. This is the type of gangster film Hollywood was making in the 1930s--it&#39;s just done with black characters now. The movie also contains plenty of swearing and some pretty graphic bloody violence. Also I can&#39;t think of any film I&#39;ve ever seen that has such a negative view of women--they&#39;re either vicious witches, use sex to get what they want or are slapped around left and right. It doesn&#39;t help at all that Gloria Hendry (the main victim) gives a terrible performance.<br/><br/>To be truthful I was struggling to stay awake. The bursts of violence helped and Williamson is tall, handsome and pretty good in the title role. But the technical goofs (there are plenty) and the by the numbers story got annoying. Poorly made on a low budget. Check out &quot;Foxy Brown&quot;, &quot;Coffy&quot; or &quot;Blacula&quot; for a good blaxploitation film.",11,8

Fred &quot;the Hammer&quot; Williamson was one of the most charismatic and cool male stars of the period. Added to that writer/director Larry Cohen (&#39;Q&#39;, &#39;The Stuff&#39;, &#39;Maniac Cop&#39;, &#39;It&#39;s Alive!, &#39;God Told Me To&#39;,etc.) and you&#39;ve got yourself movie dynamite!

Williamson plays Tommy Gibbs, a crippled ghetto kid who grows up with one thing in mind - revenge. He ingratiates himself with a local mobster Cardoza (Val Avery, &#39;The Anderson Tapes&#39;) then works his way up until one day he seizes power and becomes &quot;the black Godfather&quot;. Along the way he uses and discards many people including his girlfriend Helen (Gloria Hendry, &#39;Black Belt Jones&#39;), and creates many enemies, not least of which is corrupt cop McKinney (Art Lund, Junior Jackson&#39;s Dad in &#39;The Last American Hero&#39;), a man he has a long history with. The supporting cast in this one is really strong and also includes Julius Harris (&#39;Superfly&#39;) as Gibbs&#39; estranged father and D&#39;Urville Martin (&#39;Dolemite&#39;) as his childhood friend, the now  Reverend Rufus. &#39;Black Caesar&#39; is gritty, exciting and raw.

Both films gave Williamson the spotlight he deserved in show business with his mean, dirty style of action-packed influence. This one&#39;s just warming up. Best scene to remember: Gibbs putting on the shoe polish of a white man&#39;s face to resemble Al Jolson, only in beating the living daylights out of him as he shouts &quot;Mammy! Mammy!&quot;. As you&#39;d normally expect for a &quot;blaction&quot; classic, it&#39;s pure entertainment, and James Brown&#39;s soul music score (absent in the sequel) is the best I&#39;ve heard. There is a call for examination on Gibbs&#39; &quot;superior&quot; gang who wants to rule over the opposing race, a plot that sometimes goes overboard and needs to be studied.

Credit two people: star Fred Williamson and writer/director,Larry Cohen. In Williamson&#39;s hands, Tommy Gibbs is a magnetic presence. He is very cool and smart. His success is no surprise but also his downfall is no surprise. How he turns could have been overplayed or understated for an actor with more ego. The scene was necessary and effective because in the end this movie was not about glamorizing gangsters. Cohen&#39;s contributions are also significant. He understood he wasn&#39;t making a message film, even though the message is there. The movie is full of bloody violence (it seemed to me that during the pool massacre, some of the victims were spouting blood before they were shot) because that was what fans of this genre wanted. In the end, however, viewers see that even with James Brown blaring about what a bad mutha Tommy Gibbs was, he was just as much a pawn as everyone else.

The key opens a box that contains the both explosive and incriminating Goosic ledgers that Tommy ripped off from Goosic&#39;s office when he was reviewing them. Goosic a top bag-man for the corrupt cops and politicians has a record of all the pay-offs that they got from the mob and elsewhere through the years. Tommy is using that information to blackmail McKinney, and all those corrupt officials in them, to keep the heat off him and keep him alive as well.<br/><br/>Later getting shot on a mid-town street Tommy kills the hood who shot him and escapes from McKinney&#39;s men by jumping into a taxi and then goes to Coleman, William Wellman,his back-stabbing lawyer&#39;s office. Coleman turned out to be murdered by McKinney in order for him to get his hands on the Goosic ledgers after he, Coleman, doubled-crossed his client Tommy by giving them to McKinney. McKinney plans to pin the murder of Coleman on Tommy,to cover up his crime! In short McKinney double-crossed the double-crosser, Coleman, to frame the double-crossed,Tommy, with a murder rap. <br/><br/>McKinney instead of killing Tommy when he surprises him at Coleman&#39;s office forces him it spit-shine his shoes, now that&#39;s really rubbing it in. Tommy knocking his gun out of his hand paints McKinney&#39;s face with shoe polish and forces him to sing &quot;Mammy&quot;, McKinney&#39;s singing is plain horrible, before he smashed his head in with the shoe-shine box killing him. Still badly wounded Tommy goes to his old neighborhood in Harlem and is attacked by a gang of young toughs, Tommy Gibbs wannabes, but survives the ordeal to make a sequel to the movie &quot;Black Caesar&quot;: &quot;Hell up in Harlem&quot;. <br/><br/>The most unusual aspect about the film &quot;Black Caesar&quot; is that it was so successful that it spawned a sequel the same year, 1973, that it was released. Even though &quot;Black Caesar&quot; was to take place at the time that it was made and we see at the end of the movie a date, as if it had great historic and momentous significance, which flashed on the screen against the New York City skyline as being August 20, 1972? What exactly was that day supposed to be in world history? <br/><br/>In the &quot;Black Casear&quot; sequel &quot;Hell up in Harlem&quot; were shown in the movie that most of the events takes place two or three years into the future or in 1975 and 1976 not 1973 when the movie was made and released!

However, as we all know, once you&#39;re at the top there&#39;s only one place left to go. I&#39;ve heard a lot about this blaxploitation film over the years so I was happy to finally get to see it but in the end there&#39;s nothing too original here to keep it highly entertaining throughout. I think the biggest problem is that we&#39;ve seen this type of gangster story countless times before and this one even borrows from some classic gangster films like Scarface and Angels with Dirty Faces. Those homages are fun but the film starts to wear out in the final half hour, although things do pick up for the exciting ending. Williamson turns in a fine performance in the title role and he really was one of the classics of the genre. His tough talk and cool style fit the genre perfectly and director Cohen really knew how to use him. There&#39;s all the typical stuff from this genre including the racist whites, cool talk and this one even features a terrific opening song from James Brown.

It didn&#39;t change my opinion much either; what we have here is basically a crime thriller along the same lines as Scarface, except most of the main players are black. The film appealed to me mainly because of the fact that it&#39;s written and directed by Larry Cohen who also wrote and directed some of my favourite low budget trash films; films such as It&#39;s Alive, The Stuff, Q and The Ambulance. This is an early Cohen film and it appears he didn&#39;t get much chance to refine his craft as despite a decent directional debut with &#39;Bone&#39; a year earlier; this film mostly fits the &#39;trash&#39; bill in the bad way. The lead character is Tommy Gibbs, who starts off a young kid and gets his leg broken by a copper during a robbery. He&#39;s not best pleased and upon his return several years later, he decides to rise to power himself in order to put up a fight against the powers that stand already; both the criminal and the law enforcement.<br/><br/>Aside from the fact that the film didn&#39;t appeal to me much, it&#39;s also badly written and doesn&#39;t make up for in originality what it lacks in substance. As mentioned, I&#39;m not well versed in this genre; but I imagine it&#39;s more about style than anything else and Larry Cohen does at least give the film a cool vibe that is well done. James Brown features heavily on the soundtrack and it works with the film, although the scenes involving &quot;The Boss&quot; only served in reminding me of how Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels used the song much better. The lead role is taken by Fred Williamson and it does have to be said that he&#39;s one of the best things about the film. The central role in this film does require someone &#39;cool&#39; to play it, and Williamson certainly is that person. The plot is a problem because it&#39;s never exactly difficult to tell where it&#39;s going and this results in the film not having a great deal of suspense. Cohen&#39;s script doesn&#39;t really make us care for the lead character either, which means it doesn&#39;t really matter where the film goes.

Compared to most films in this genre, the production values are much better--with a decent performance by Fred Williamson and a very good, but violent, script to assist him.<br/><br/>The film begins with a kid taking a bribe to a corrupt cop. The amount is short and the sadistic White cop beats the Black child severely--sending him to the hospital and filling the kid with a desire for revenge. Years pass and this kid turns out to be Fred Williamson--a tough ex-con who has visions of being a mob boss. Through mob contracts, he&#39;s able to ingratiate himself to the prejudiced Italian boss. With so many racial slurs going his way, you just know that eventually Williamson is going to give this man and the rest of his White friends their &quot;comeuppance&quot;--though in the meantime, he carves out a little piece of the mob pie for himself.<br/><br/>Eventually, of course, Williamson is the leader of the mob and now he has to work with the same cop who beat him years earlier. This is because the cop is now the police captain. You know that Williamson must one day pay him back, but you also know that he might just die in the process! Exciting, well-paced and interesting throughout. The only shortcoming I really see in the film is its frequent nudity, adult content (Williamson rapes his girlfriend) and all the blood.

tt0069792,rw1668857,e_tucker,7,2007-06-05,"Say what you will about Larry Cohen, for me he is the sui generis of maverick, grindhouse directors. He is my urban guerrilla film maker of choice. Who else shoots all over NYC without permits, unleashing wounded Harlem kingpins on unsuspecting midday shoppers on 5th Avenue, or racing cabs down NYC sidewalks with thugs in hot pursuit, on foot no less? Although he has been slotted in the grindhouse and cult categories, Cohen doesn&#39;t really belong in either, mixing classic Hollywood b-unit gangster formula and 1970s blaxploitation, with a healthy measure of social comment bludgeoned in.<br/><br/>BC is a well-known tale of the rise and fall of a crime boss that follows the conventions of it&#39;s namesake, Little Caesar. It&#39;s protagonist, played by a convincing and charismatic Fred Williamson, wants power, revenge and some social and economic justice for the people of Harlem. He gets it, by Bogarting his way into the confidence of a local Mafia boss, blackmailing corrupt city officials into submission and siphoning some of his ill-gotten gains into legitimate black owned business. But as his ambition and power grow, so does the hatred of his enemies and the alienation of his family, girlfriend and allies. Like Caesar, he is headed for a fall, but unlike Rico, it&#39;s a fall that grandstands it&#39;s way across Manhattan in broad daylight, even making a pit stop for a little well earned payback, culminating, surprisingly in a homage to Buñuel.<br/><br/>If you like slick and polished, don&#39;t look here. As cheap as a low budget film can get, Cohen used his own basement and his mom&#39;s house as sets, and every time he comes up with an expensive car, I wonder who he borrowed it from. But his best set is great, a raw, gritty and unsuspecting NYC of the early 70s. The acting is sometimes sub-par or over-the-top (this fits though) but often good, especially by Gloria Hendry, girlfriend (who we don&#39;t see enough of), Julius Harris, estranged Dad, Minnie Gentry, Mama Gibbs and Williamson best of all.

tt0069792,rw1516845,Anonymous_Maxine,7,2006-11-07,"Now, when I speak of the accuracy of this movie I am, of course, speaking either prophetically, I guess, or hypocritically, because I am neither black nor old enough to have been alive when it was made. Nonetheless, having had bad experiences with blaxploitation films (such as the astonishingly bad Sweet Sweetback&#39;s Badaassss Song), I recently saw an outstanding documentary called Badasss Cinema which really opened my eyes to this entire genre and taught me about the things that had previously caused me to sort of look down on some of the films. I have a tendency to pick movies apart when a lot of really little things bother me (the James Bond movies are particularly susceptible to this), and that happened in a major way in watching movies like Sheba, Baby, Coffy, and Black Mama, White Mama. <br/><br/>It was interesting to learn the history behind this genre, as well as the way it seemed to appear, become wildly popular, and then fizzle out with surprising speed. The genre&#39;s disappearance can largely, and not surprisingly, be blamed on Hollywood, for reasons which I&#39;ll leave to the above mentioned documentary to explain. <br/><br/>Armed with a new outlook on blaxploitation, I rented Black Caesar and was pleasantly and not so pleasantly surprised at the same time, strangely enough. It is not surprising that a blaxploitation film almost named after one of the first gangster films ever made , Little Caesar would attempt to resemble the most famous gangster film of all time, which was released the year before. <br/><br/>The infamous Fred Williamson plays the part of Tommy Gibbs, a hardened youth who grew up with an intense desire to firmly establish himself as a force to be reckoned with on the streets. He finds tremendous success, and the movie moves forward making intense sociological statements about the plight of black people in early 1970s America. Unfortunately, as the movie goes on it dissolves into more and more ham-handed lashes out at white people in general, especially that favorite blaxploitation scapegoat, the White Cop, or the White Guy in Suit. <br/><br/>While the African American community certainly had, and still has, in many ways, a lot to lash out and to be resentful about, it was really sad to see such a smart and well made film resort to contriving situations between Gibbs and white people who were so outwardly racist and brutal toward him just for the sake of setting themselves up for his revenge. The shoe-polish scene near the end of the film, as well as the ear scene relatively early in the film are prime examples. <br/><br/>(possible spoiler) On a more subtle note, it is also noteworthy that a great length of time is spent showing Gibbs staggering through the streets of New York at the end of the movie because of a gunshot wound. This takes place in broad daylight and not a single person tries to help him, offers to call the police, or even so much as puts a hand over their mouth in sorrow or sympathy. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed Black Caesar and I think it&#39;s one of the better blaxploitation films that came out of the 1970s. But you can certainly scratch subtlety off of its list of successes.",2,3

It charts his rise and fall... much in the manner of Scarface (either version).

I won&#39;t go into much detail as I urge you all to watch it, but I might add a couple of trivial points: you should watch it back to back with the sequel - Hell Up In Harlem.

I deliberately state &quot;subtle&quot; reference, because the name itself isn&#39;t mentioned anywhere throughout the entire film, but the similarities between protagonist Tommy Gibbs and the Roman emperor are clever and relevant. Tommy also builds his own way to the top; in this case the conquering of a mafia empire that quickly becomes as over sized, cluttered and unmanageable as the Roman Empire. His methods are also merciless and strategic, but he also gradually transforms into a dictator feared by his loved ones as well as the target of conspiracies and assassination attempts. I don&#39;t know about you, but I think it&#39;s quite an ambitious and intelligent concept for a supposedly simple and low-budgeted piece of 70&#39;s exploitation trash! That being said, I have to admit that I nevertheless expected even more from this blaxploitation classic. I&#39;m certainly not an expert in this domain, but I&#39;ve seen the most important ones (&quot;Across 110th Street&quot;, &quot;Ganja &amp; Hess&quot;), the most outrageously entertaining ones (&quot;Foxy Brown&quot;, &quot;Truck Turner&quot;) and the passable ones (&quot;JD&#39;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;Blackenstein&quot;). &quot;Black Caesar&quot; somewhat balances between the first two categories, as the script isn&#39;t solid enough to be important and not cool enough to be outrageously entertaining. Basically it&#39;s just Fred Williamson looking mean and shooting white mobsters in the chest so that he can take their place in the New York gangster hierarchy. During this process he abuses and scares off the people he initially wanted to protect, like his mother and childhood friend. The film features too many dull parts and repetitive sequences. Every conflict is solved with a bullet and end with a close up of a dead body covered in thick and bright red blood syrup. The most memorable sequences include the intro, with a teenage Tommy enrolling the criminal life, a virulent taxi/on foot chase in busy NY streets and a sadist final confrontation between Tommy and his nemesis. Other terrific elements for exploitation fanatics to enjoy are the swinging soundtrack (with James Brown&#39;s unique voice) and authentically raw and gritty set pieces. Williamson is excellent, of course, but Art Lund gives an even more impressive performance as the disgustingly corrupt cop McKinney. Larry Cohen&#39;s direction is uneven, but it was one of the first ventures of this multi-talented and versatile cult genius. There&#39;s a sequel entitled &quot;Hell Up in Harlem&quot;.",4,0
tt0069792,rw2591051,tomgillespie2002,7,2012-04-02,"Not one to miss on an opportunity, Larry Cohen&#39;s second feature film utilised the explosion of blaxploitation cinema after the successes of Sweet Sweetback&#39;s Baadasssss Song (1971) and Shaft (1971), and crafted his own &quot;black&quot; action film, modelled on the 1931 film Little Caesar. Fred Williamson plays the titular role, a boy from the streets, witnessing and being victim of brutality from the white community, and particularly a local police officer, McKinney (Art Lund). As an adult, Caesar&#39;s goal is to become kingpin of Harlem, and he won&#39;t let anything stand in his way.<br/><br/>The narrative is a story told over, which focuses on a person who looses everything in the pursuit of power, including childhood friends, wives, and particularly looses sight of the person that they are. It&#39;s always great to watch a Cohen movie from this period. When filming in the streets (in this case New York - of which is his usual setting), his guerilla-style is self evident: clearly in the making of these films, Cohen does not get any kind of permission to film, he simply turns up and does it. In one scene, Williamson has been shot, the camera follows him down the busy street from a roof top, and passers by seem to want to help him. It&#39;s these elements of exploitation cinema that I embrace.<br/><br/>Whilst this is certainly not one of Cohen&#39;s greatest (check out his horror output for some terrifically socio-political subtexts), the film oozes charm. Not only do we have the easy-cool of Fred Williamson, the film also has the ubiquitous Gloria Hendry , although not in her usual kung-fu-influenced fighting mode. Even though this film is less well known than Shaft or Superfly (1972), who&#39;s soundtracks were composed by soul giants Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield respectively, Black Caesar&#39;s soundtrack is provided by the godfather of soul himself, James Brown: Break it down!

tt0353496,rw2017123,detroitmalujoe,9,2009-01-27,"I must admit that Godfather is in my top Malayalam comedy list, along with In Harihar Nagar, Nadodikattu, AkkaraEakkare and Kilukkam.Disguised as a drama feud between two families as being the plot, the plot is delivered with so much comedy that it is first and foremost a laughing bonanza. The dialogue that&#39;s delivered in this movie is great and you need to understand Malayalam to really get the full effect - most times subtitles do not serve the local colloquialisms justice. If you like a good, old Malayalam comedy and have not seen this one you are definitely missing out.<br/><br/>The actors do a great job with Jagadish, Mukesh and N.N. Pillia commanding the leads. N.N. Pillai in his old age played the role of a disgruntled, senile patriarch of a gunda family perfectly. The events that unfold in the movie are great - the music is entertaining as well!<br/><br/>Joe",7,1

tt0353496,rw7318152,SAMTHEBESTEST,8,2021-09-07,"Godfather (1991) :
Brief Review -<br/><br/>The Grandfather of All Family Action-Comedies made in Malayalam Cinema. All hail Siddiqui-Lal Duo!!! 1991 was meant to be the Most Memorable year for Malayalam Cinema when they got so Many Cult Films in different genres. Sandesam, Kilukkam, Amaram, Bharatham and Godfather five cult in five different genres, all in the same year. Any other year has competition for that? I don&#39;t think so. I have watched &#39;Hulchul&#39; many times on TV and enjoyed it a lot which was nothing but just a simple copy-paste of this Malayalam Classic. Siddique-Lal who had already delivered couple of evergreen comedies in Malayalam cinema, came up with another timeless script and their direction made it even better. The writing of this film has done half the job as it mixes up multiple elements like Comedy, Action, Drama and Family Values together very nicely and nothing looks outdated or cliched. That&#39;s the best thing you know because you are not doing anything out of the world, you are just using same old formulas with some new ideas inspired by youth&#39;s references and blend it perfectly by carrying two generations together in one narrative. Two young scions from rival families each pretend to fall in love with the other in order to humiliate their rivals, but end up falling in love for real. Now they must find a way to get married anyhow by convincing or tricking their family members. The entire cast Unit in the film is perfectly suitable to their characters. Mukesh, N. N. Pillai, Thilakan, Innocent, Bheeman Raghu, Kanaka, Jagadish, Siddique and Philomina every single artist has done fabulous in his/her own way. The screenplay is engaging and doesn&#39;t let you find any boring moments and that&#39;s why the film has high repeat value. If i had not seen Hulchul so many times then i would have definitely watched this one multiple times. Overall, another Timeless Comedy and Must See Product by Siddiqui-Lal.<br/><br/>RATING - 8/10*<br/><br/>By - #samthebestest.",1,1
tt0353496,rw10061127,aryannairarun,9,2024-10-11,"This film has nothing to do with the story of the og Godfather. Its a comedy film where the title happens to be the same. And this is probably the best film from the duo siddique - lal. This film also has a hindi remake called hulchul from the copycat director priyadarshan. But if you are malayali, then don&#39;t watch the remake. The best part is the performance from nm pillai. This performance makes the movie iconic and his line &quot;marrakano?!!&quot; Is still very well remembered. The rest of the cast especially thilakan, innocent, and mukesh are great. The jokes still are funny even after rewatching a countless number of times. There is some family drama in the film but it is handled fairly well and not too overdramatic.
