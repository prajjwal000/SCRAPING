tt7131622,rw5019130,g_bake,7,2019-07-26,"I love Tarantino. I was super excited to see this. The movie started. And then it went. And I waited for the plot. And then it came and went within the last 15 minutes of the film. Then I left confused and a little disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie just felt like Tarantino wanted to show off how much he knows about film history and how nostalgic the old Hollywood made him feel. The acting was amazing. The cinematography was amazing. The storyline just wasn&#39;t there though. I want to say I loved it so bad but it just felt so flat to me.<br/><br/>The characters didn&#39;t really develop at all. Leo&#39;s character just kind of changed halfway through with only a narration as to why he was different. Brad Pitts character was the exact same the entire film. Margot Robbie&#39;s characters development was that she finally said like 20 words at the very end.<br/><br/>The ending was the most enjoyable part without a doubt. That felt like a classic Tarantino scene. The rest of it though just felt like a normal movie. The dialogue didn&#39;t feel like him to me for the most part, with the exception of a few scenes. The soundtrack was phenomenal and caught the vibe of the movie flawlessly.<br/><br/>Maybe I was just hoping for more or maybe I missed out on something. It was an enjoyable movie, but it just felt off to me. I really hope he will make a final movie to end his career with a bang, because this is not the one",4532,1175
tt7131622,rw5022231,RMS1949,3,2019-07-27,"It reminds me of that old fable. People go to see Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio in a film by Tarantino and assume it has to be great despite what they are actually seeing on the screen.. The film is incredibly slow paced and neither funny nor suspenseful. Throwing in a 5 minute fantasy violent scene at the end after over two hours of boredom did NOT make me change my mind..
Sadly disappointing to this fan of most Tarantino films.",3242,1911
tt7131622,rw5018427,angiek-78966,2,2019-07-25,"I LOVE QT films and couldn&#39;t see this movie fast enough. All I can say is what was that all about? It was so boring. Did anyone edit this film? Leonardo&#39;s character was not likable. The only person tolerable was Brad Pitt. Nothing happened what so ever. The dialogue was not clever. The movie never went anywhere at all. It was just endless scenes of other movies being made. People driving in cars. Bare feet over kill. By the time the ending happened I didn&#39;t care anymore. I wanted to LOVE this movie, but I haven&#39;t been this bored in a long long time. I wish i felt differently.",3201,1818
tt7131622,rw5021391,carlvan1977,10,2019-07-27,"The first 2 hours is only for lovers of everything late 60s retro,great cinematography and outstanding acting. The last 45 minutes fasten your seatbelts because classic Tarantino kicks in.",3841,1073
tt7131622,rw5019889,goaticusguy,10,2019-07-26,"Here&#39;s why not everyone will like this movie: it&#39;s not like all of Tarantino&#39;s other movies, and it&#39;s not like any modern movies either. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a melancholy, slow burning, comedic love letter to an age of Hollywood that we find ourselves disconnect from nowadays.<br/><br/>The point of this movie isn&#39;t to be just like Pulp Fiction and tell stories that have no meaning. In fact, I would argue that Tarantino wants each and every story to have a meaning. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a faded action star struggling to hold onto his career and fame. Every scene he was in was enjoyable, as he internally argues with himself to be better than he is. He can&#39;t find work except for as a typecast villain, and turns down an offer to go overseas initially because he thinks it&#39;s too far a step down from his past career. Dalton&#39;s story was not as fun to me as his stunt double, Cliff Booth&#39;s (Brad Pitt), but I will get to that in a minute. Dalton&#39;s story, some will say, was boring, overdrawn, and pointless. I say it was the most important and interesting storyline in the movie. Rick is an alcoholic, and deals with a lot of anger towards himself, particularly in his trailer (you&#39;ll see what I mean), and the long scenes showing him act out his part as the villain in the western are extremely entertaining as DiCaprio does some brilliant work letting us see Dalton as an actor without losing touch with him by slipping into acting of his own. He finally decides to go overseas, but most of that time is spent in a montage. When he returns, he dons a new Italian wife and an entirely new fashion straight from Europe. He doesn&#39;t do much towards the end, except for burn a manson follower alive in his pool, and then he finally becomes friends with his neighbors. I&#39;ll also get to that when I talk about Sharon Tate. Rick is representative of Hollywood at the time of 1969, and unless you are familiar with film history, that will be lost on you. In 1969 movies like Easy Rider, Bonnie and Clyde, and The Graduate were changing the face of Cinema by eroding censorship codes and finally getting the studios to hand the reigns to directors, thus entering the age of auterism. Actors like Rick were becoming absolete in film for a number of reasons, but mainly that they hadn&#39;t had to search for work whilst under the studio system, they just signed a contract and found work immediately. Roman Polanski, his neighbor, was one of the directors that was now given a lot of free reign in this age, . Dalton&#39;s character expressed the frustration many probably felt at the time, and Tarantino built a character that was beautifully acted by DiCaprio.<br/><br/>Cliff Booth on the other hand, was the most Tarantino character in the movie. I think he&#39;ll be the fan favorite, because he requires no historical context or empathy to understand. He&#39;s a stunt double who lives much worse than his star, Dalton, and is a no-no sense badass with a muddled past. His scenes were incredibly fun, as Pitt brought a certain energy to each scene that glued you to the screen waiting for his next move. Particularly at the end, when Tex had him at gunpoint and he was tripping on acid. Obviously he had the situation under control, but we as the audience have no idea until he sicks the dog on them. Booth was a character you expect to see in a Tarantino movie. None of his storyline was used for what people will say is &quot;pointless&quot;, mainly because he is the most involved with the Manson clan.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the Manson clan is hardly shown in the movie. Charles himself only shows up twice, and only says a few words. I actually like this choice, because it left a lingering thought that perhaps Manson was a danger at all times, and didn&#39;t play to the audience the way we thought it would. It wasn&#39;t a story about the Manson murders. Manson just happened to be going on at the time Dalton and Booth were having their struggles, and it intersected.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my last point, and that is of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Her role, while a tad less utilized than I expected, was Central because the real life Tate was murdered by the Manson clan. If you go in as an audience member with that knowledge, you go the whole movie waiting for something to happen to her, and it never does. Tate herself was a happy, blooming actress who spent time with friends and danced (a lot). This carefree manner was underlying a want to be famous, as she tells people who she is and is clearly disappointed when they don&#39;t recognize her. Tate plays a role in this story of showing the era of actors now replacing Rick Dalton, and also showing special to Hollywood, the silver screen&#39;s allure. As this is essentially a long love letter to Hollywood, Tarantino pens what drew him to the screen through Tate.<br/><br/>With all of its references, obscure or in your face, there is a delicious amount to absorb, especially for cinefiles. Tarantino has the viewer to sit back, eat up the screen, and imagine we are right there with the characters in a wonderfully painted portrait of a Hollywood long gone. This movie will be misunderstood because of the expectations for the Manson murders, and because audiences nowadays expect action on every corner, which Tarantino&#39;s name can be attached to in some capacity. Without any crazy special effects to speak, simply a fantastic script and acting, I think many audience members will get bored or not understand why it&#39;s entertaining to others. I personally think it&#39;s one of Tarantino&#39;s best, if not his absolute best, and will stand the test of time for movie lovers everywhere. Agree or disagree, we all have to admit that Brad Pitt&#39;s dog was awesome.",2805,813
tt7131622,rw5024899,Jimmy_the_Gent4,10,2019-07-28,"I have seen this film twice in the last two days, I probably will see it many more times.Tarantino has shocked and surprised me before, but this was the biggest shock of all. The movie is set in the Hollywood of 1969, just before the brutal Manson family murders.<br/><br/>Leonard Dicaprio and Brad Pitt give career high performances. Dicaprio is Rick Dalton, a TV cowboy actor who longs for movie stardom but has now hit the skids. Pitt plays Cliff Booth his stunt double/driver and all around best bud. They also represent doubles of each other in real life, though Dalton is angry and frustrated at his failings in life while Booth is perfectly happy to be his pal&#39;s gopher and handyman. There is good recreations of TV westerns of the time, Dalton had been the star of &quot;Bounty Law&quot; a show that never existed but is clearly based on Steve McQueen&#39;s &quot;Wanted Dead Or Alive&quot; series. Dalton is now playing guest role villains on TV. An actual series &quot;Lancer&quot; is recreated here, I never saw this show when it aired since it was on up against &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Dalton has some funny and touching scenes opposite a precocious 8 year old actress while doing the &quot;Lancer&quot; episode. The late Luke Perry has his final film appearance in these scenes also.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie has an almost magical presence playing actress Sharon Tate. Tate unfortunately is best known today as the most famous of the Manson family murder victims. We see not only how beautiful she was but also how good and kind she was as well. One of my favorite scenes is when she goes to a movie theater to watch &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; a film she made in 1968 with Dean Martin. We see actual clips of the movie, (with the real Sharon Tate) and cuts back to her reactions, she becomes delighted when the audience laughs at her comedy bits and applauds at her fight scene with Nancy Kwan.<br/><br/>The film starts to turn dark when Cliff picks up a teenage girl hitchhiker who wants to be taken to Spahn Ranch, a run down movie set where he once worked. I have read nearly everything about the Manson case, so I knew where it was going now. Cliff sees a bunch of mostly hippie girls hanging around and asks if George Spahn the original owner of the ranch still lives there. The scenes at the ranch are quietly disturbing. Dakota Fanning (I did not recognize her) plays Squeaky, one of the real life Manson girls. Her vacant eyes and cold manner make for some suspenseful moments. Cliff is concerned about his old friend George and demands to see him. He finds him now old and blind (Bruce Dern in a great cameo) but at least alive. Cliff is still suspicious but leaves the ranch.<br/><br/>The final act comes up for the biggest shock of all. Rick has returned from several months filming some spaghetti westerns in Italy.He has also gotten married to an Italian actress. It is now August 8 1969. Cliff and his faithful pit bull Brandy are staying the night at Rick&#39;s house. Sharon Tate and some of her friends arrive at her home (which is right next door to Rick) to spend the evening together. Then Manson followers Charles &quot;Tex&quot; Watson, Patricia &quot;Katie&quot; Krenwinkel, Susan &quot;Sadie&quot; Atkins and Linda Kasabian are driving up the road. I knew what was coming and was dreading this moment, I was hoping that Tarantino would not show the gruesome murders but I was preparing myself.
Then Rick hears them driving up and has an angry altercation with them, then I was a bit surprised that real life characters were suddenly intermingling with fictional characters on a night when a horrible historic moment happened. When Rick goes into the house, the killers suddenly realize that he was the star of the TV show &quot;Bounty Law&quot;. Then psycho Sadie goes on a rant about how TV showed her generation how to kill by showing murders every week on the small screen. I had heard some Manson followers had actually said this. Linda is too scared to go with the other three and takes the car keys and drives off leaving them. Another change in the real story, Linda did not participate in the murders but did stay with them, so once again I am getting bewildered. Tex, Sadie and Katie than decide to go to Rick&#39;s house rather than Sharon&#39;s. I am wondering are they now going to kill them also? Then the most surprising thing happens, Cliff, his pit bull and Rick decide to fight back against these scummy creeps leaving them to be battered and massacred. Brandy has some great scenes as one of the most heroic dogs I have seen in film. My head was reeling by this time, I kept thinking &quot;Are they really doing this?&quot; Then came the ending, Rick is now safe, Cliff injured but alive. And now Rick gets to meet his next door neighbor Sharon and her friends. I am still in shock but then for the first time we see the title on screen &quot;Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood&quot; and then I finally get it, this is a Hollywood story not real life, this is what we wish would have happened.<br/><br/>I finally had to see the film again for a second time so I could actually enjoy that climatic scene, without the dread and confusion I had the first time.
This is a phenomenal work, like nothing I have ever seen and probably never will again.",2279,1244

The script mocks every theory on character and plot development. Yet, the same gurus who would trash a rookie script writer for bringing anything less then perfect, are bowing now in humble awe to the great QT.

tt7131622,rw5009047,DanTheButler,,2019-07-21,"I don&#39;t typically leave IMDb reviews but this film deserves so much praise for its risky screenplay in such a dark true crime setting.<br/><br/>For 2 hrs, 41 minutes, I was taken 50 years back, experiencing Hollywood&#39;s film industry as a comedic drama filled with desire, tension and everyday life.<br/><br/>I liked Brad&#39;s character the most, but Leo easily matched with his own performance. A definite see-it-in-theatres watch. Bring your sense of humor though. There are lines of dialogue and laugh out loud bits that completely satisfy your curious mind. Expect everything you would from Tarantino, but also what you wouldn&#39;t.<br/><br/>I gave it a perfect 10 because I forgot I was watching a nearly 3 hour film, even though it still wasn&#39;t long enough for me. I would like to see a director&#39;s cut up to an hour longer as I think this is a unique case that extra footage would only help such an already powerful story.<br/><br/>I had the privilege to watch an early 70mm screening of this film at the cinerama dome with the director, Tarantino, in the audience. It was a surreal experience I&#39;ll never forget.",1635,1038
tt7131622,rw5023394,rubberto,3,2019-07-27,"Even great actors can&#39;t save this storyless plotless meandering piece of self-indulgent nostalgia. It looks like they had a great time making it and to heck wirh the audience. I love the old-time movie feel of most of QTs films, but come on, you need a plot. You need to tell a story. As QT famously said a movie should make you want to sit down over a piece of pie afterwards and talk about it. Soon as our
group walked out all anyone had to say was how painfully boring and self-indulgent it was. That was it. QT you gave us nothing to talk about.",1346,857
tt7131622,rw5094119,mcoats-71101,1,2019-09-01,"All this critical acclaim for this film (mainly because it&#39;s a Tarantino one) is so baffling. So what&#39;s wrong with it? For a start nothing actually happens throughout until the last 10 minutes. It&#39;s a slow, turgid, self congratulatory affair with drawn out scenes and tons of tips of the cap to the &#39;era&#39; - through the soundtrack and product placement of 1960s packaging, or &#39;real life&#39; characters like Sam Wannamaker&#39;s appearance - that just aren&#39;t needed. They even splice Di Caprio into the Great Escape as a &#39;what if?&#39; moment...but all for what? Just Hollywood slapping itself on the back again about being Hollywood.<br/><br/>There were genuine tense moments like when Pitt&#39;s character visits the Manson family allotment that turn into a damp squib. Again why was that scene so long? Why did they spend so much time on Di Caprio playing the baddy in the western but no time at all on his character&#39;s move to Italy (apart from the fact Tarantino wanted to imagine what 1960s spaghetti western posters would&#39;ve looked like with DiC in them!). And what was the point of Al Pacino? Or Sharon Tate&#39;s character for that matter once you see the ending....?<br/><br/>This was a missed opportunity that could&#39;ve been a great piece on an actor&#39;s dwindling career that just turned into a boring series of sort of linked scenes...albeit quite well acted ones. Tarantino is become the new Woody Allen...actors want one of his films on their resume despite the fact he hasn&#39;t made a good one in so long",1218,748
tt7131622,rw5017171,Rainbowbeany,10,2019-07-25,"Just got out of a screening. This movie was perfection to me! Everything plays a part in the experience. This is some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. I was swept away with the look, music, and story. The best part of this movie is when you are spending time with these characters. Rick Dalton has quickly become on of my favorite characters of all time! Leo lights the screen on fire every time we are with him. He is the ultimate package in this by giving Rick so much depth. Pitt does an amazing job as well. Cliff Booth would be a guy I would want to hang out with. It&#39;s nice to see a movie about two guy friends that support one another in different facets of life. It is so much deeper than some sort of average buddy cop affair. Margo Robbie gets a shout out too. She truly embodies Sharon Tate and glows on screen. She is amazing. This is Tarantino at the height of his powers. He gets the best performance out of everyone in every part of this movie. There are a lot of very enjoyable smaller parts in this. It&#39;s also great to see him working with the second generation of actors and actresses he has worked with in the past. I was taken on a ride to every part of Hollywood in this. From the glitz and glamour to the dark and twisted. This movie has a really awesome third act that I wouldn&#39;t dream of spoiling. I consider it a cherry on top of an already perfect movie. The directing, writing, music, cinematography, acting were all on point. It&#39;s a slow burn but all in all this movie is about Hollywood and the different aspects of it. The rising and falling of it&#39;s movie stars, and the people that flock to it in hopes of a different life. Go in with an open mind and let the movie take you on it&#39;s ride and you won&#39;t be disappointed.",970,655
tt7131622,rw5019173,jgsealy,9,2019-07-26,"Another great Tarantino film, though I do agree there are times where it feels a little indulgent and meandering. The climax of the film is fantastic though, and it does make it feel like it was all worth it for the most part. There isn&#39;t really a defined narrative, which may put some people off but Tarantino&#39;s sublime dialogue and the great performances make all of the scenes at least entertaining. It&#39;s no Pulp Fiction, but it definitely is one of the most original films I&#39;ve seen in a while.",883,553

The acting was terrific by Brad Pitt, Leonardo and Margot Robbie. The storyline sadly fell short, way short. The era was captured really well however I sat through the first hour thinking it was painting the scene and that the real action would start. I kept thinking that until the last 20 minutes when things finally came together, however, that was nearly 3 hours of film to sit through before any real appearance of the film I was expecting.",809,480

This movie like Pulp Fiction, is not about the plot. Pulp Fiction has no plot as well. Once upon a time in Hollywood is about the characters and about situations. You need to have some culture in movies to like this one. Of course is too long for if you started to watch movies after 2005. It s obvious that you never seen the old classic movies. Then you wondering why cinema has changed and we dont have good movies anymore. Because of you guys, new generation, with no patience, fans of CGi, Fast and Furious, etc. Cinema will never be the same because of nowdays audience without culture in movie. Thank you Tarantino for this amazing movie!",602,501
tt7131622,rw5017996,ferguson-6,8,2019-07-25,"Greetings again from the darkness. Hippies, westerns, short skirts, pompadours, catchy pop songs ... all have (mostly) disappeared from our world. Back to save the day and the memories, and twist a little history, is Quentin Tarantino, the ultimate film geek. His latest reminds us of a bygone era of movie stars and old school filmmaking ... a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support. There have been plenty of big screen love letters to Hollywood, but few if any, were filmed with so many personal touches and call-backs to the director&#39;s own films.<br/><br/>In keeping with the request from Mr. Tarantino, this review will not include any spoilers or details that might negatively impact anyone&#39;s initial viewing of the film. It&#39;s a reasonable request since the film is so unique and literally packed with nostalgia, sight gags, and historical bits and pieces - some accurate, some not so much. There is a lot to take in and process, and the full impact of the initial viewing might result in awe, shock or disgust ... and maybe even all of the above. So this will be a pretty simple overview peppered with some insight that should enhance rather than spoil the experience.<br/><br/>The film covers about 6 months in 1969, but in reality, it all takes place (at least what we see on screen) in 3 days. Leonardo DiCaprio (possibly his best ever performance) plays Rick Dalton, an actor who had a hit (fictional) TV western series in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s entitled &quot;Bounty Law&quot;. Since the show ended, Rick has been unable to make the successful transition to movies. For comparison, think of Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and Burt Reynolds - all actors in TV westerns who found greater career success in movies. Brad Pitt (the epitome of cool) stars as Cliff Booth, Rick&#39;s stunt double, friend, driver, handyman, etc. While Rick is desperate to find the next stage of his career and fend off being forgotten, Cliff, a Vietnam vet, is accepting of his lot in life. Rick lives in a swanky Hollywood Hills home next door to hotshot director Roman Polanski and his starlet wife Sharon Tate; and Cliff lives in a trailer behind the Van Nuys Drive-In with his well-trained Rottweiler Brandy.<br/><br/>There are multiple parallel stories to follow, and a key one involves the aforementioned Sharon Tate. Margot Robbie nails the role and bounces about town with the energy and sweet aura that we imagine she possessed. All 3 of the lead actors - DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie - have knockout scenes that I&#39;d love to be able to discuss, but I&#39;m not sure how without giving away too much. What I can say is that each of these three talented actors prove that movie stars still exist.<br/><br/>This is Tarantino&#39;s 9th film as a director (he counts the 2-part KILL BILL as one film), and he claims he will stop making films after number 10. There are multiple features we can count on in a QT film, and a ridiculously deep supporting cast is one. Going through each of the characters played by actors you will recognize would take a page and a half, so I&#39;ll cover only a few here. Margaret Qualley is a scene stealer as Pussycat, one of the Manson family girls. You likely remember her from the recent &quot;Fosse/Verdon&quot; or &quot;The Leftovers&quot;, and here she fully embraces the hippie look and spirit. Emile Hirsch plays hairdresser Jay Sebring, one of those in the house with Ms. Tate on that fateful night, and Mike Moh plays Bruce Lee so convincingly that I was momentarily confused when he took off his sunglasses. Also making appearances are some Tarantino regulars: Kurt Russell (as a stunt coordinator and narrator), Michael Madsen (as an actor), and Bruce Dern as George Spahn (a late replacement after Burt Reynolds passed away). Others of note include Maya Hawke (Uma Thurman&#39;s daughter), Austin Butler (recently cast in the title role of Baz Luhrmann&#39;s Elvis biopic) as Tex Watson, Rumer Willis (Bruce&#39;s daughter) as actress Joanna Pettet, Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen, Al Pacino as agent Marvin Schwarzs, Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme, and the late Luke Perry as actor Wayne Maunder (&quot;Lancer&quot;). 90 year old Clu Gulager (&quot;The Virginian&quot;, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW) makes an appearance, and Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich from THE SOUND OF MUSIC) tears into his role with gusto as director Sam Wanamaker. There is even a TV Guide cover featuring the late great character actor Andrew Duggan (&quot;Lancer&quot;). Some of these, and many more, are like cameos, but it&#39;s still fascinating to see the faces.<br/><br/>1969 was 50 years ago, and Tarantino does a remarkable job of recreating the look of Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, Cielo Drive, and studio backlots. Much credit goes to Production Designer Barbara Ling and Set Decorator Nancy Haigh (frequent Coen Brothers collaborator and an Oscar winner for BUGSY). Arianne Phillips does a tremendous job with the costumes that look natural for the time period, and not like something right off the wardrobe racks. Three-time Oscar winning Cinematographer Robert Richardson (HUGO, THE AVIATOR, JFK) is back for his 6th Tarantino film, and he captures the look and feel and vibe of a time that is so personal to the director.<br/><br/>It&#39;s been three and a half years since THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Tarantino&#39;s most recent film, and probably his worst received. This one is clearly personal as it captures the time and place that he fell in love with movies. The dichotomy of rising starlet and fading cowboy as neighbors is a brilliant way to make a point about times changing. This was a time of transition in the United States - a new culture was upon us, and whatever innocence remained, was surely snuffed out on a hot August night in 1969. As usual, his use of music serves a purpose. We are treated to Roy Head, The Royal Guardsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders, among others. QT also shows us plenty of bare feet (another trademark). What is unusual is that the film lacks the trademark mass dialogue. This one kind of meanders ... right up until it doesn&#39;t.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino is a living, breathing film geek (that&#39;s a compliment) who has earned the right to make the movies he wants to make. This one took him a lifetime to live, 5 years to write, and it will take you 161 minutes to watch. It was warmly received at Cannes, but no one can expect to &quot;catch&quot; everything Mr. Tarantino has served up in one viewing. That said, one viewing will likely be one too many for quite a few folks (especially many under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood). Some will categorize this as an overindulgent nostalgia trip for movie nerds. And they are likely correct. But for those of us who complain that too many movies are remakes, re-treads and comic books, there is no denying Tarantino delivers a unique and creative viewing experience - and it&#39;s not meant for everyone.",635,422
tt7131622,rw5019827,edwardpayson,10,2019-07-26,"Tarantino at his best, in rare form. Dicaprio and Pitt acted their faces off. Its funny smart and original in a world of remakes and comic book films. A true new Masterpiece.",582,434
tt7131622,rw5022312,onetwentyinnafiftyfive,10,2019-07-27,"I just got in from watching Once Upon a Time In Hollywood. I&#39;ve been a Quentin Tarantino fan since, well, Reservoir Dogs. Amid his trademark over-the-top violence and gore, I have always felt he treats the art with a respect that&#39;s often lost in controversy. His execution of heartfelt homage is so authentic that it becomes his biggest criticism, and to the less astute, is often dismissed as blatant theft.<br/><br/>Once Upon a Time In Hollywood is the homage of all homages. Critics are calling this Tarantino&#39;s &quot;love letter to Hollywood&quot;, but in reality it&#39;s much, much more. This letter addresses a Hollywood that&#39;s no longer recognizable, and that melancholy is woven into the fabric of this film. While there is the requisite violence, witty banter, and unpredictable outcomes, this is probably the most mature and intelligent Quentin Tarantino film yet. It also deviates from the Tarantino template by remaining somewhat linear. With a runtime of just over two hours and forty minutes, the pacing is artfully throttled, allowing the audience to take in the authentic and painstakingly detailed scenery. The period music drives the narrative but never becomes a music video. The performances are flawless. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt will deservedly receive accolades for their performances as the main characters, but honestly there is not a single weak performance among the ensemble. And lastly, the subject matter: I was admittedly apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. While no one would be surprised to see these heinous acts glorified or even caricatured, Tarantino continues to be unpredictable. At the risk of spoiling the plotline, I&#39;ll just say this is handled tastefully and even respectfully, yet true to the classic Tarantino flair.<br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood demonstrates a more mellowed Quentin Tarantino touch but it&#39;s far from a departure. I suspect audiences that normally can&#39;t stomach the assaulting violence and shock of the Tarantino brand may very well enjoy this film.",553,407

Instead he gives us a bit of a mess filled with forced 1960s references, really forced, unlike &quot;American Graffiti&quot; which just melded them into the fabric of the film. Even the afterscene was forced and certainly not worth waiting for.<br/><br/>Yes the acting was generally pretty darned good. Yes, the camera work was dazzling. But the film just seemed superficial and artificial.<br/><br/>I realize there are plenty of folks who just adored the film and concluded it was innovative and clever beyond belief.

tt7131622,rw5068050,rustonreviews,5,2019-08-18,"DiCaprio and Pitt collaborate with Tarantino once again for the directors ninth (and supposedly penultimate) feature film as writer/director. Set in 1969 Hollywood, the film follows fading actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his loyal stunt double Cliff Booth (Pitt) as they navigate their way through the absurdities of Hollywood life. Inbetween their exploits we follow Sharon Tate (Robbie), who gleefully indulges in all the fun and glamour that Tinseltown has to offer. I&#39;m a big Tarantino fan, so naturally my expectations for Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood were high. What a shame it is then to report his ninth feature is an uneven, average affair that doesn&#39;t live up to the brilliance of his previous efforts.<br/><br/>Both DiCaprio and Pitt make for a great pairing, and they both carry the film even throughout its most sluggish moments. Margot Robbie is sadly wasted in the film as Tarantino gives her practically nothing of worth to work with, resulting in what feels more like an over glorified cameo as opposed to a legitimate role worth playing. Narratively speaking, the film is uneven and at times tedious to sit through. Tarantino is known for his engaging storylines, intriguing characters and sharp dialogue, but none of that is to be found here. Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood doesn&#39;t really have a cohesive storyline, emphasized largely by the elimination of chapter breakdowns, a storytelling technique Tarantino is widely known for. At its core, it&#39;s a celebration of Hollywood moviemaking during the sixties and an exploration into the relationships between actors and their stunt doubles. While there are a handful of noteworthy scenes to be found here, they aren&#39;t enough to save the film from being a pretty average affair. Technically speaking the film is very well made and contains great shot composition along with a solid soundtrack. Unfortunately, there just aren&#39;t many ideas on display worthy of hanging a feature film on, making for a disappointing outing from one of the modern masters of cinema. If this is indeed Tarantino&#39;s penultimate effort, hopefully his swansong will return to the quality of his previous works.",452,271

If I did not have my sister next to me pointing out the small references to this serial killer&#39;s story, I would not have understood at least 80% of the movie. Understanding the significant details adds a specific intensity in every other scene, like you know something that the characters don&#39;t, and always keeps your eyes glued to the screen.<br/><br/>Although I can see how a few scenes were fairly slow, and the middle was not particularly engaging, Tarantino definitely had a purpose for each scene, even if I don&#39;t have all the answers. Even the smallest of details, like a gun holster of beer or the way the characters drive down the highway, reveals hidden thoughts, feelings, and backstories to the audience.

Like many others, Tarantino is one of my favorite directors. I respect his fundamental consistency and his creative license above all else, and he lets both of those aspects shine through brightly in his 9th undertaking. It was this particular flavor of storytelling that he used this time around that I wasn&#39;t fond of. There was nothing difficult to follow about it, but it just didn&#39;t want to piece itself together into any coherent arcs. I can certainly appreciate that this was the feel Tarantino was going for, but it was not one I could appreciate during my viewing. With that being said, the story wraps up into a bizarre, unique, and satisfying conclusion that reminded me why I will always be in theaters for this director. What makes Tarantino so great is that he maintains such sound film fundamentals when taking on these strange and creative projects. His actors blew their roles out of the water, his cinematographer enhanced their potent performances further, and his set/costume decorators crafted a world of immersion. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is not a film everyone will love, but it is a film everyone should see.",298,221

There&#39;s none of Tarantino&#39;s sparkling dialogue, no iconic scenes, and the ending simply pulls off the same trick that the director employed in Inglourious Basterds -- changing history (only in this instance, it all seems to be in questionable taste given what really happened fifty years ago).<br/><br/>As a fan of cult movies, Italian westerns, Bruce Lee and old TV shows, and as someone with an interest in the Manson murders, I fully expected to be enthralled by Tarantino&#39;s re-creation of 60s Hollywood, its colourful characters, and one of the darkest moments in its history, but was totally taken aback by how mundane this movie is. If you want to watch Brad Pitt feed his dog, mend a TV aerial and drive a car, then this is the movie for you; if you want to see Leonardo DiCaprio talk about books to an 8 year old and record an episode of a dull TV western (a scene that went on way too long) then have at it.

The result : it&#39;s like you go to a promising party but end up cornered most of the night by some drunk guy who absolutely wants to share his opinions about everything.<br/><br/>Right from the start you get vignette after vignette, self-indulgent, overlong spoof sequences that bog down the main narrative. What with all the stuff Tarantino has learnt about movies he can&#39;t shorten exposition to clever ellipses ? Once upon a time I thought he was very good with dialogue, but I guess it is no fun to toil and write fine lines (no just snappy one-liners from time to time) when Sony will greenlight anything you want to shoot.<br/><br/>Once upon a time in Hollywood does not have a plot. It is the New Wave auteur in Tarantino who does not think he needs a plot. He has a couple of characters, a dozen anecdotes and the rest is talent. Self-conscious talent, lazy talent, talent isolated in the middle of a creative process. More like naked skills, each trying separately to express its full potential.<br/><br/>The hero and his sidekick are losers: how do you build a story around losers ? You need rhythm and some kind of McGuffin (wasn&#39;t it all there in Pulp Fiction?), not some vague exploration of the meaning of life. The plot is limited to the draft premise: a has-been TV actor and his stunt double cope with reality in Hollywood around the time of the Manson Family murders.
The backdrop of the murders is the only narrative asset. We are teased all along, we even have an extensive reconstitution of life at the Spahn Ranch... all this just to toy around and end with the kind of ultra-violent carnival that Tarantino fans seem to revere.
Clearly the challenge of mentioning the sordid Tate-LaBianca murders of August 1969 was not only above Tarantino&#39;s mental ability, but grossly using background anecdotes from it as fodder for his inspiration was within his moral scope.<br/><br/>As always I am judging this movie on its merits from a movie enthusiast point of view. But Tarantino is much more than a movie enthusiast. He is a guttonous movie fanatic. He is a guru with followers who let themselves be impressed, just like with Charles Manson.

The story focuses on the relationship between fading alcoholic TV star Rick, and his long-time stunt double Cliff. Unfortunately the pair share a tired connection, neither man has much personality and their exchanges never hint at the electricity between Vincent and Jules in &#39;Pulp Fiction&#39;, or Louis and Ordell in &#39;Jackie Brown&#39;.<br/><br/>The movie looks decent enough, but oodles of time is wasted venerating the TV shows and films of that era. There&#39;s an endless passage where Rick delivers some routine over-acting as a cowboy villain in a TV pilot, inter-cut with Sharon Tate visiting a cinema to watch a spoof spy movie in which she had a minor role. Voice-overs laboriously explain the narrative gaps as more than a hundred minutes are spent on a procession of background scenes. Eventually, the ghostly apparition of an actual story emerges after Cliff gives one of Manson&#39;s hippie runaways a ride to the derelict movie ranch where the &#39;Family&#39; were residing. The ensuing confrontation shows the potential of Tarantino&#39;s idea - but he loses the plot again in order to pay homage to spaghetti westerns.<br/><br/>The &#39;action&#39; finally arrives at an overblown climax where reality gets a fairy tale tweak which is doubtless the point of the entire enterprise.

Every detail of this period is done to a tee; and it&#39;s in all the most minute aspects, whether it be a can of dog food or a radio station, where this film is elevated to masterpiece status.<br/><br/>Remember when Jules and Vincent instantly became one of cinemas classic duos in Pulp Fiction? You can now confidently say the same thing about Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth - Leo and Brad give performances of a lifetime as these endearing, hilarious and, at times, even heart-rending characters. They&#39;re joined by a beyond stellar supporting group that&#39;s filled beautifully by the likes of Margot Robbie, Timothy Oliphant, Al Pacino, (the late) Luke Perry, Emile Hirsch and many more who all breathe life into this wonderfully unique and engaging story.<br/><br/>All in all, it&#39;s a fantastic dive into the Golden Age that&#39;s fulls of twists at every turn and shines even brighter in its quieter moments when it&#39;s love for everything old cinema is at the forefront of its telling. At its core, it&#39;s invigorated by a guy whose talent as a storyteller is exceeded only by his sheer love for film and that is Mr. Quentin Tarantino. And for anyone who thinks the runtime could/should have been shorter, remember that QT was trying to make many of us who had never grown up/experienced that era (like myself) feel close to it. This meant every seemingly trivial scene/moment&#39;s sole purpose was to create as authentic an atmosphere as he could&#39;ve conjured up.<br/><br/>It&#39;s as ambitious a vision as one could muster and he truly nailed it with flying colors, creating a fairytale that enthrals you in ways you never knew were possible.

I understand the 3 involved at the end of the film we&#39;re actually the 3 who murdered Sharon Tate and her friends, but can you imagine if Charles Manson decides himself to show up to Rick&#39;s house only to meet Cliff, Brandy, and Rick, fresh from taking names (no you&#39;re name was dumber than that... classic line!)?

I read other reviews, and believe I see a pattern as to why some didn&#39;t like it, and I think it&#39;s just lack of appreciation of the time and the storytelling. It was an homage. I remember tv of that era: weekly westerns and crime dramas like Gunsmoke or Perry Mason. Shows that had guest stars who were usually familiar actors from movies or older shows. It was a love story about friendship and honor. What others said was too much jumping around wasn&#39;t really paying attention. It clearly stated the dates of what was happening. It was highlighting moments in each character&#39;s lives to convey their emotions in addition to tying up the end. And I believe it was a fairytale, hence the title &quot;Once Upon A Time...&quot;.",198,144
tt0068646,rw1183339,SJ_1,10,2005-09-30,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don&#39;t like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn&#39;t change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That&#39;s why it gets ten out of ten.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn&#39;t seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it&#39;s far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.<br/><br/>The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It&#39;s a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven&#39;t seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn&#39;t disappoint.",983,220

Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.",702,324
tt0068646,rw1066533,BrandtSponseller,10,2005-04-24,"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving &quot;business&quot; guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie&#39;s (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.<br/><br/>The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the &quot;greatest films of all time&quot;. Even though I&#39;ve given it a 10, I wouldn&#39;t put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I&#39;ve given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it&#39;s only because it&#39;s so highly regarded--if you&#39;ve not experienced the film yet. I think it&#39;s a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.<br/><br/>Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you&#39;ve watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, &quot;Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?&quot; The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film&#39;s appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.<br/><br/>But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather&#39;s brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi&#39;s violence is effective, setting that knob to &quot;11&quot; doesn&#39;t make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.<br/><br/>To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of &quot;oscillating&quot; dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.<br/><br/>But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It&#39;s tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota&#39;s score.<br/><br/>Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis&#39; unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you&#39;re looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) &quot;zoom out&quot; from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it&#39;s a long monologue from a minor character).<br/><br/>Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn&#39;t believe it&#39;s something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.<br/><br/>If you haven&#39;t seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the &quot;greatest film of all time&quot; hype. That&#39;s only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you&#39;ll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood&#39;s more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it&#39;s as much a &quot;historical family saga&quot; as a crime or gangster film.",470,358
tt0068646,rw0123518,ks4,9,2002-12-25,"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..<br/><br/>With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..<br/><br/>Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn&#39;t take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.<br/><br/>This is definetely a &quot;must see&quot; masterpiece.",552,229
tt0068646,rw3038370,CalRhys,0,2014-06-20,"&#39;The Godfather&#39; is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed &#39;The Godfather&#39; I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let&#39;s start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, &#39;I believe in America&#39;, it&#39;s crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film&#39;s &quot;threshold&quot;. This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a feared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a respected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970&#39;s film industry (including a certain horse&#39;s head), &#39;The Godfather&#39; epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleone&#39;s are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood&#39;s greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made.",690,73
tt0068646,rw0123344,Neve_Fan,9,1998-08-11,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn&#39;t have a single flaw.  Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life.  There&#39;s scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don&#39;t forget them.   Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime.  Its really a movie about family.  The dialogue is just unbelievable.  I&#39;ve seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I&#39;m still amazed at how perfect it is.  The music, the acting, everything.  People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there&#39;s no way  that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather.  The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie.   Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I&#39;m crazy.",454,289
tt0068646,rw1496808,mattrochman,10,2006-10-14,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn&#39;t like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando&#39;s ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.<br/><br/>To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.<br/><br/>Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don&#39;s children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they&#39;re put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.<br/><br/>2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character&#39;s character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).<br/><br/>3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn&#39;t to make films as short as possible.<br/><br/>All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn&#39;t mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.<br/><br/>I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.",511,155
tt0068646,rw0123460,jojofla,1,2002-08-05,"I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as &quot;The Greatest Movie of All Time&quot;.  I&#39;ve seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind.  And I&#39;m not a teenager raised on MTV; I&#39;m in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I&#39;ve seen as many classics (American &amp; foreign) that I can get my hands on.  But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin&#39; in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time.<br/><br/> Singin&#39; in the Rain, at least, I get (it&#39;s just my intense dislike for Donald O&#39;Connor that makes me dislike this film).  But The Godfather?   It&#39;s just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence.  Give me a break.  The fact that this movie is so &quot;beloved&quot; has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers.",201,455
tt0068646,rw0123309,"b-a-h TNT-6",10,2002-03-05,"The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for &quot;gangster movies&quot;, but its influence goes well beyond that.<br/><br/>The Godfather&#39;s influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every &quot;organized crime film&quot; nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public&#39;s imagination.<br/><br/>But to say that The Godfather is simply &quot;influential&quot; is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as &quot;a movie about gangsters&quot;. The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.<br/><br/>As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors&#39; performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.<br/><br/>The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone&#39;s daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don&#39;s power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.<br/><br/>However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone&#39;s ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.<br/><br/>To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito&#39;s younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his &quot;innocence&quot; and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.<br/><br/>I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.<br/><br/>There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra&#39;s real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won&#39;t go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.<br/><br/>The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.<br/><br/>The Godfather certainly doesn&#39;t need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.",532,112

I tried to watch it with an open mind, without letting the hype dilute an even slight bit of impartiality - and I just can&#39;t say it&#39;s a very good movie. Perchance if soap opera was its own category, this may stand true to its title as &quot;#1&quot; on the IMDb.<br/><br/>   It perplexes me how people can call this landmark moviemaking when they probably have not seen works from other directors - Kurosawa, Truffaut, Lang... - all of whom had a much better eye than Coppolla. Most of these greats are now forgotten, with the exceptions of occasional screenings at film schools where one discovers that the Contemporary filmmaking style overseas  (1950s and 1960s)  was duplicated by American directors in the 1970s. <br/><br/> So what was wrong with this movie? Nonexistent or loose plot: No suspense, climax, excitement, or outcome. I thought the acting/characters were forgettable. Any other actor could have pulled off what Brando did and the fact they went through all that trouble to make him 10 or 20 year older just proves they shot for name recognition. <br/><br/> There were only a few things that I remember in this 3 hours of triviality: the &quot;offer you can&#39;t refuse&quot; line, Don Vito collapsing in a garden while a child obliviously plays, Caan&#39;s Santino character getting holed up, and bullets consistently going into foreheads. Maybe the artful yet repellent depiction of gratuitous violence is what made this such a masterpiece. But style without substance does not a good movie make.<br/><br/> For those who say &quot;oh, you just didn&#39;t get it, see it again&quot;, please get your mind out of the gutter - stop basing your opinions on what you&#39;re conditioned to like. <br/><br/>The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes, big time.

tt0068646,rw0123507,sddavis63,6,2002-11-25,"First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.<br/><br/>I thought &quot;The Godfather&quot; was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn&#39;t call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve finally seen it, but nothing more.<br/><br/>The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone&#39;s daughter&#39;s wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone&#39;s &quot;business&quot; never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn&#39;t actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn&#39;t think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone&#39;s son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family &quot;business&quot; to the eventual &quot;Don.&quot;<br/><br/>It&#39;s not that I thought this was a bad movie.
