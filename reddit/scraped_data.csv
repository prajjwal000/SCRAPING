[LOTM V8] Power of miracles,/r/LordofTheMysteries/comments/1iyddvc/lotm_v8_power_of_miracles/,text,t3_1iyddvc,5,15,Pale-Investment-2338,"So, I was re-reading LOTM (just for fun). When I got to the section about the Genie lamp and how it grants wishes, 10 wishes to be exact but in an extremely distorted way, I was confused. 

But then, I later realised that the genie probably grants wishes because it is accumulating the power of wishes by using the miracle invoker characteristic that is used to seal it. However, the seal also distorts the power of wishes such that the number of wishes that anyone can make doesn't exceed 3 as it would kill the user. 

In other words, it is possible that, either after fulfilling a lot of wishes from many different users, each not making more than 3, the genie would break the seal or finding someone extremely strong that can withstand the harmful effects of 10 wishes which will free the genie. 

Just wanted to share this, as I found this detail pretty interesting."

[Coi End]Outer gods sephirots speculations.,/r/LordofTheMysteries/comments/1iyt3k9/coi_endouter_gods_sephirots_speculations/,text,t3_1iyt3k9,1,3,Distinct-Moment-6243,"So someone actually asked cuttlefish if he will reveal the names of the outer gods sephirots. Cuttle fish answered that he thinks they do not need names as they are concepts. So special thanks to that guy who asked this. I really wanted to know this one. But sadly cuttlefish thinks it's meaningless. So I will make some speculation on how those sephirots might look or interact as cf won't reveal anything. 

First let's talk about the easy ones. 

-Mother Goddess of Depravity : Cradle of chaos / Womb of origin/ Fetus of beginning.(Hyphothtical scenario that she died as we can't have her sephirot if she's alive.So Original creator killed her) 

First of all it's revealed that this sephirot contains chaos primogenitor and world pathway. While chaos primogenitor is the birth of original creator, World is like a cradle for him. But we can also interpret as fetus or womb. As they are also related to birth. Here it mainly depends on what the world represents. Is it a cradle while chaos primogenitor is the child or is it the fetus and chaos primogenitor is the essense. 

Lastly where does it exist. Of course it exists in the physical world. 

-Mother Tree of Desire : Garden of Desire / Paradise of Filth/Desire Heaven 

It's the easiest one to figure out. Mtod is a tree while she has control over desires. So it makes sense for the selhirot to be a garden. While this garden can be also be described as paradise as Paradise is where all your desires are fullfilled. Actully it can also be considered heaven in a sense 

-Uncertain Mist : Everchanging Mist 

Well we do have have physical information of this great one. As the mist is indefinable and constantly changing. Either it's this name or it's name is just uncertain mist. Also it's the selhirot of chaos mist pathway which is the bridge between light and darkness, order and disorder. So it should at least be a little connected. 

So it's physical description could be of a black market. While It would exist in the physical world. 

-Monarch of Decay: Decaying Empire. 

First of all most great ones ats title has really similarity to thier sephirots so from thier names we can figure out the names of the sephirot. So as it's name is Monarch of Deacay. It must rule over something. Here we can use words such as nation/kingdom/empire. I mainly used the empire as the monarchy can be represented with this. 

Now how does it look like. I would sayit looks similar to nation of disorder and eternal darkness. Also most probably it would existin the spirit world as decay is one of the aspects of death. While deaths are associated or connected to the decay of spirit. 

-Goddess of Fate : Ship of Destiny (Another hypothesis she died) 

Her core ability focuses on the conscious manipulation of fate. As well as she use the River of Fate the most. Also she can use the river of fate to revive. So I would say her sephirot has to be a ship or something similar. 

So it should exist in the spirit world's River of Fate naturally. 

-Circle of Inevitability : Road of Salvation 

First of all coi represents samsara and salvation. Samsara is something where you loop in the same day. So the sephirot is city/village/roads etc. 

It also should exist in the spirit world. 

-Primordial Hunger : Primal Heaven 

For Primordial Hungers sephirot it is similar to natural instincts.As Primordial Hunger is one of the only great ones even among other great ones to be more ferocious and has unleashed it's own natural instincts. I would say it would be some kind of heaven type thing. As Hunger and releasing one's own primal nature. It's similar to bathing in one's own desires. 

It of course exists in the physical world. 

-Inextinguishable Ravings : Bell/Temple of Origin 

It represents the evarlasting and eternal phyche of original creator. So it should be of course be a bell or temple. Temple is the closest thing I could find. 

Lastly I don't think it exists at all. As Inextinguishable Ravings doesn't have it's own body. So I would say it exists in the core of mind islands of all living beings. 

High Dimensional Overseer : Dimension Overseeing Tower. 

It's name alone should be evident of it's sephirots name. 

I guess it exists both in the spirit and the physical world. 

Supernova Dominator : Star of Collapse 

It's abilities are derives from the fundamental forces of the universe. A star actually possess all of those forces. As well as a star is necessary for living. As we can see from SD water related abilities. Which most probable is the tidal wave of the moon. So all in all it should be a star. 

It certainly exists in the physical world for sure."

cf: yes, he can 

I can’t believe I have to say this…but this isn’t universe travel or multiverse shit, this is an application of the information world (what we see in volume 6 when mysticism interacts with modern world) 

we saw Lumian and his friends entering a screen before this is literally just that 

it’s not multiverse or even an entire universe, just entering a tv screen which would show you a world consisting of only the things shown on screen, not even an entire world (somewhat similar to Groselle’s travels book) 

I know a lot of people only read summaries or don’t even interact with CoI at all but cmon….we can expect some level of reading comprehension from this fandom right?….right!?"

[COI V0] Things I miss about COI,/r/LordofTheMysteries/comments/1ixqmt2/coi_v0_things_i_miss_about_coi/,text,t3_1ixqmt2,8,21,shadowpillow,"Just a small COI appreciation post, now that I've been away from it for a while and have been rereading LotM and other things. 

Things I now kinda miss about COI:

The logical complexity and plots that were revealed. Since V3, I started feeling that every event or fight was accompanied by some logical twist or deeper plots with multiple parties, which made it very interesting to speculate and try to figure out what's going on, and who's doing what. I think the LotM fights usually just don't have that same sense of canny turnaroundness-because-this-person-did-that-in-this-logical-way, and I don't think I've really seen it in other fiction too. It just has a unique vibe to it.

Day by day investigations. Especially in COI V6, I loved the methodical investigations of the surroundings and speculating on what was going on with each new clue.

Working to apply mystical principles that we know all know to each event. (As opposed to applying as we learn, now we have to test our application abilities as ""experienced Beyonders"".)

DaddyKlein aura. I kind of realized that when we were begging for scraps of seeing Klein in COI, we appreciated all the little moments so much more. And Klein was just really cool. A lot of these parts also pain me, but I also spent a lot of time thinking about them and feeling them, causing me to question his decisions more in LotM too, and keep alao evaluating if Klein's final decision in V8 was something I could apply to my own life or not.In V8, we also get to see the fulfillment of his journey, and validation for his decision, as the theme of ""We cannot let those who are born gods be gods, as then we will be forever subjected to their whims"" is extoled and shown, particularly when Audrey talks to herself in the later chapters, highlighting one of the main themes of COI and LotM as a whole—the reason why we need people like Klein in power, who are aware of humanity and their difficulties, rather than those like Amon, GA, or CW, or any of the more crazy and distorted ODs.

That moment in COI V6 where we got to see Zhou Mingrui from the outside subtly interrogate and use sophistry to give out information, haha. Seeing it from the outside was really great. Oh, and every Zhou Mingrui moment and thought there, ofc too.

Cool symbolism and foreshadowing. I feel like understanding the symbolism deepened my understanding of a lot of mysticism. I felt a lot of my understanding of the LotM world and logic was deepened just by reading COI, without yet rereading LotM very much. Tracing through everything in my mind for hours to figure out what the heck was actually going on was kind of great, and the symbolisms and theories behind how they work were really interesting, especially when we could have discussions about them.

The uniqueness of the story composition. Many of us have complained about Lumian's inner voice being lacking, and even though I do really agree many narrative components were left a bit unloved in favor of the plot components, overall some of the writing choices were very brave and interesting. It doesn't fit the standard, and maybe the form doesn't quite match the function, but I do find it compelling and unique in an interesting way. COI in particular just feels different from any other work of fiction that I've read, in a different way than LotM.

COI V7 wrapping up everything and tying the whole point and missing threads of COI V1 and the rest of the story was really cool. The end of COI V7 was actually a banger in my book, though it had some disturbing parts too. It actually wrapped up the main plot threads of the story so well for me that I almost felt V8 was extraneous before I remembered the whole apocolypse thing again (which I felt extremely nervous about and thought the result could swing anywhere on the spectrum due to the horror of V7's ending, so kudos to CF for that). And V8 did well with the worldbuilding of the human spheres and symbolism (though I do wish we had gotten more epilogue, the stuff that was there was pretty cool and also somewhat disturbing).

Lumian riding his flaming coat rack and dancing a weather dance midair like a madmanin V7. And his continual urge to get people he dislikes to call him pepé will always crack me up.

Franca building gundams, and Antony's perpetual psychological invisibility.

This might be a bit weird, but also, the untransparency of people? The characters can feel less relatable or understandable because of this, but their psychology always seemed to be consistent across the board when you pick up the hints. So it felt like the book was always encouraging you to think for yourself and read for yourself, in the same way you look at strangers in the outside world, even if it made it more difficult to read. That kind of falls into the unique style aspect, but I feel it can also train up your understanding of people and reading situations by absorbing the hints, so that was pretty cool. I also liked how in COI V6 they were always consulting Anthony on the best way to talk to Rozanne to help prevent a welling of trauma/existentialism, and also to deal with potential subconscious cues in the dream.

Anyway, I thought I'd just write one or two points, but it turns out there's actually quite many things I liked about the story. I know not everyone here will agree, but I just wanted to put a bit of a COI appreciation post out there, because there really are a lot of things I enjoyed or found compelling about the story, and I think others have too. 

What did you like about the story? What were your favorite parts? 

Anyway, peace, and praise the Fool."

we're both honestly very satisfied with this. I made the abilities for the most part, and my friend made the sequence names and refined the abilities to fit the names. The original theme for this was actually ""Bullshit"" and we somehow reached this beauty. imo a very balanced pathway. Except seq 6 and 3, which may seem too broken for their sequence, but they are meant to be taxing towards spirituality to balance it out."

cf: yes, he can 

I can’t believe I have to say this…but this isn’t universe travel or multiverse shit, this is an application of the information world (what we see in volume 6 when mysticism interacts with modern world) 

we saw Lumian and his friends entering a screen before this is literally just that 

it’s not multiverse or even an entire universe, just entering a tv screen which would show you a world consisting of only the things shown on screen, not even an entire world (somewhat similar to Groselle’s travels book) 

I know a lot of people only read summaries or don’t even interact with CoI at all but cmon….we can expect some level of reading comprehension from this fandom right?….right!?"

[COI V0] Things I miss about COI,/r/LordofTheMysteries/comments/1ixqmt2/coi_v0_things_i_miss_about_coi/,text,t3_1ixqmt2,8,21,shadowpillow,"Just a small COI appreciation post, now that I've been away from it for a while and have been rereading LotM and other things. 

Things I now kinda miss about COI:

The logical complexity and plots that were revealed. Since V3, I started feeling that every event or fight was accompanied by some logical twist or deeper plots with multiple parties, which made it very interesting to speculate and try to figure out what's going on, and who's doing what. I think the LotM fights usually just don't have that same sense of canny turnaroundness-because-this-person-did-that-in-this-logical-way, and I don't think I've really seen it in other fiction too. It just has a unique vibe to it.

Day by day investigations. Especially in COI V6, I loved the methodical investigations of the surroundings and speculating on what was going on with each new clue.

Working to apply mystical principles that we know all know to each event. (As opposed to applying as we learn, now we have to test our application abilities as ""experienced Beyonders"".)

DaddyKlein aura. I kind of realized that when we were begging for scraps of seeing Klein in COI, we appreciated all the little moments so much more. And Klein was just really cool. A lot of these parts also pain me, but I also spent a lot of time thinking about them and feeling them, causing me to question his decisions more in LotM too, and keep alao evaluating if Klein's final decision in V8 was something I could apply to my own life or not.In V8, we also get to see the fulfillment of his journey, and validation for his decision, as the theme of ""We cannot let those who are born gods be gods, as then we will be forever subjected to their whims"" is extoled and shown, particularly when Audrey talks to herself in the later chapters, highlighting one of the main themes of COI and LotM as a whole—the reason why we need people like Klein in power, who are aware of humanity and their difficulties, rather than those like Amon, GA, or CW, or any of the more crazy and distorted ODs.

That moment in COI V6 where we got to see Zhou Mingrui from the outside subtly interrogate and use sophistry to give out information, haha. Seeing it from the outside was really great. Oh, and every Zhou Mingrui moment and thought there, ofc too.

Cool symbolism and foreshadowing. I feel like understanding the symbolism deepened my understanding of a lot of mysticism. I felt a lot of my understanding of the LotM world and logic was deepened just by reading COI, without yet rereading LotM very much. Tracing through everything in my mind for hours to figure out what the heck was actually going on was kind of great, and the symbolisms and theories behind how they work were really interesting, especially when we could have discussions about them.

The uniqueness of the story composition. Many of us have complained about Lumian's inner voice being lacking, and even though I do really agree many narrative components were left a bit unloved in favor of the plot components, overall some of the writing choices were very brave and interesting. It doesn't fit the standard, and maybe the form doesn't quite match the function, but I do find it compelling and unique in an interesting way. COI in particular just feels different from any other work of fiction that I've read, in a different way than LotM.

COI V7 wrapping up everything and tying the whole point and missing threads of COI V1 and the rest of the story was really cool. The end of COI V7 was actually a banger in my book, though it had some disturbing parts too. It actually wrapped up the main plot threads of the story so well for me that I almost felt V8 was extraneous before I remembered the whole apocolypse thing again (which I felt extremely nervous about and thought the result could swing anywhere on the spectrum due to the horror of V7's ending, so kudos to CF for that). And V8 did well with the worldbuilding of the human spheres and symbolism (though I do wish we had gotten more epilogue, the stuff that was there was pretty cool and also somewhat disturbing).

Lumian riding his flaming coat rack and dancing a weather dance midair like a madmanin V7. And his continual urge to get people he dislikes to call him pepé will always crack me up.

Franca building gundams, and Antony's perpetual psychological invisibility.

This might be a bit weird, but also, the untransparency of people? The characters can feel less relatable or understandable because of this, but their psychology always seemed to be consistent across the board when you pick up the hints. So it felt like the book was always encouraging you to think for yourself and read for yourself, in the same way you look at strangers in the outside world, even if it made it more difficult to read. That kind of falls into the unique style aspect, but I feel it can also train up your understanding of people and reading situations by absorbing the hints, so that was pretty cool. I also liked how in COI V6 they were always consulting Anthony on the best way to talk to Rozanne to help prevent a welling of trauma/existentialism, and also to deal with potential subconscious cues in the dream.

Anyway, I thought I'd just write one or two points, but it turns out there's actually quite many things I liked about the story. I know not everyone here will agree, but I just wanted to put a bit of a COI appreciation post out there, because there really are a lot of things I enjoyed or found compelling about the story, and I think others have too. 

What did you like about the story? What were your favorite parts? 

Anyway, peace, and praise the Fool."

[LOTM General]There is a serious problem with art credits in this community,/r/LordofTheMysteries/comments/1ix5e2w/lotm_generalthere_is_a_serious_problem_with_art/,text,t3_1ix5e2w,22,64,Automatic_Lack_5069,"I think the first thing I noticed when I joined this fandom was that fact that no one seems to credit artists. I get it, sometimes it can be hard to find the creator but this goes beyond this. Multiple people have said to me, “it’s too much work” which is so disrespectful to the ppl who actually made the art you are using. 

To make things worse I swear half this fandom pretends not to see the giant DO NOT USE COMMISSION. I have so much respect for the ppl in the fandom who actually credit. There is a dedicated channel the official discord to find art credits yet ppl still don’t credit? 

Not only that I feel like I always see ppl say “lotm artists are on a different level” “we have so many good fanarts” THEN DONT CREDIT. If u actually respected artists then u would give them credit. Sometimes I even see ppl complaining that there isn’t fanart of certain characters like it’s somehow artist’s responsibility to give the fandom art? If you want fanart of characters make it yourself and then maybe you’ll see how difficult art is and why artists want credits. Plus there has been a surge in use of ai to “expand pictures” which is BEYOND DISRESPECTFUL. Ur not going to credit and then feed artwork into ai. 

All of this is to say, I know finding artists can be hard but just taking a little time out of your editing routine to put some artists usernames in the caption would cause the fandom to become that much better. With the donghua coming out soon we should at least make our fandom more respectful anyway. 👍　just please guys 🙏🙏"

[COI General] New Pathway Settings (Preliminary TL),/r/LordofTheMysteries/comments/1iww852/coi_general_new_pathway_settings_preliminary_tl/,text,t3_1iww852,9,39,Bazel-Geese,"The Mother Tree of Desire Pathway (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/y-vxTSSGOU63uJHMle0QLw): 

True Name:
Mother Tree of Desire;
Father of Devils;
Perpetual Blatherer;
Heartless God. 

(Capable of reuniting with its own lost “Father of Devils; Lord of Deviants; Source of Curses” to become the most formidable of the Great Old Ones apart from the Pillars. It can also harbor an extra non-Pillar Sefirah, attaining power comparable to a Pillar—albeit without a corresponding Pillar symbol.) 

Mythical Creature Form:
A humanoid giant tree covered in chaotic scales. Its surface was adorned with enticing crystalline fruits, glistening alluring flowers, various metallic emblems, black hearts, bare tumors, and coins from different civilizations. 

At the tree's upper reaches were two heads. The lower head was male, eyes closed, exuding bizarre desires. The upper head was female, with green hair and a face of extraordinary beauty, possessing a charm that spoke directly to affection.

Low Sequence

Sequence 9: Scrooge
(Greed and Gluttony)

Incites greed in others—especially effective when a specific object is used as a medium.

Itself becomes increasingly greedy and miserly, gaining the ability to sense, within a limited time and area, the whereabouts of items once possessed but now lost.

Also triggers appetite in others, with greater effect when mediated by a specific object.

Its practice of not wasting food renders it more robust and powerful than its outward appearance suggests.

Sequence 8: Sex Addict
(Lust)

Perpetually ravenous and in a constant state of heightened arousal; while showing a certain resistance to some influences, its resistance against desired targets is markedly reduced.

Appears to be continuously expending its own energy, resulting in notable enhancements in strength, reaction speed, overall speed, agility, and durability.

Can subtly induce lust in targets through eye contact, language, or gestures—distracting them; further, through direct touch or spell-like abilities, it can evoke varying degrees of lust, at its strongest temporarily robbing a person of rationality.

Highly skilled in concocting aphrodisiacs and love potions.

Capable of discerning the unique hormonal scents of different individuals.

Mid Sequence

Sequence 7: Actor
(Desire for Expression)

“Imitate to perfection” – possesses extraordinary makeup skills, precise use of various props, superb acting, and an excellent ability to mimic. This prowess manifests both in the physical realm and in the occult: by imitating an ordinary person, even astral entities are altered, making it nearly impossible to detect his extraordinary nature; when mimicking a soldier, he becomes adept in melee combat and marksmanship, and so on. However, performances involving the extraordinary abilities of others remain superficial—unless a particular transcendent individual is mimicked and studied long-term, in which case a similar but attenuated ability may emerge.

Driven by an intense desire to perform and be seen.

Can instill in a target a powerful urge to showcase themselves and crave attention, thereby inducing emotional instability, irritability, and agitation.

Sequence 6: Recipient
(Desire for Success and Recognition)

Fueled by a yearning for success and acknowledgment, it can trigger a surge akin to an adrenaline explosion—colloquially described as “activating one’s mini-universe.” (Unlocking potential)

Sequence 5: Fallen Tree Spirit
(Also known as the Baby Cupid, Spirit of Lust)

Primarily associated with emotions and lust, it is capable of creating illusions and dreamscapes while also possessing the usual powers of a tree spirit—such as “conjuring vines” and wielding branches as arrows.

The specific tree chosen as its host confers unique traits, such as a temporarily elevated status or enhanced resistance to being completely destroyed.

High Sequence – Saint

Sequence 4: Tree Supplicant
(Yearning for Knowledge and Survival)

Driven by the desire for wisdom and the instinct to survive, it can call upon trees to assume human form and even command tree-people.

By praying to different trees, it receives varied responses, manifesting different abilities. Essentially, the Mother Tree of Desire itself can be regarded as a tree—it bestows its eternal howls.

Sequence 3: Desire Priest

Acts as the embodiment of the very concept of desire. As long as one harbors any desire, they are subject to its influence.

Additionally, the Desire Priest can temporarily strip others of their sanity, making the target seem as if they have lost their soul.

High Sequence – Angel

Sequence 2: Cupid

Wields dominion over the power of love, capable of making anyone fall in love with itself, and can also, through appropriate mediums, forge love between any two or more individuals—affirming that love, like other divine powers, is an authority beyond mere human attributes.

Sequence 1: Leviathan

Embodies the authority corresponding to the desire for jealousy and domination over others—“Thus I have heard: the failure of one is indeed disheartening, yet the success of a friend kindles even greater resentment.”

Marks the initial encounter with the authority of rationality—corresponding to the Heartless God. (TL note: Knowing this, Heartless God might better be translated as ""Irrational/Mindless God"" [God of Lost Minds] but this alr has an official TL way back in book 1.)

High Sequence – True God

Sequence 0: Patriarch

The sovereign of all sentient beings, akin to a paternal figure. He is both the rebuke of anger and the murmuring of pain. His eternal howls echo amid desire and emotion, drawing sentient beings into a spiral of depravity as they chase after illusions.

As long as desire burns and the howls persist without reason, the Patriarch endures—yet once he perishes, another will be born from the realms of desire and emotion.

Sects Worshipping the Mother Tree of Desire (apart from the Rose School of Thought):

Bliss Society

Tree-Worship Church

Non-Egoist Society

Hall of Honor

Only Love Society

“Seekers of Knowledge” (resembles a sect of the God of Wisdom and Knowledge)

Naturism Sect"
